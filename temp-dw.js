	<h3>Green Parking Permit</h3>
	<h3>About the Permit</h3>
	<p>A green parking permit is for ultra low-emission vehicles (ULEV). A ULEV is any electric or hybrid vehicle that emits
	    less than 75g of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre travelled, with a capability of travelling a minimum range of 10
	    miles with zero CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p>A green permit allows you to park in pay and display on-street bays in the city centre or in Council city car parks.
	</p>
	<p>The scheme is for anyone with an eligible vehicle, irrespective of home address but If you do not comply with the
	    conditions of the scheme you may receive a parking fine.</p>
	<p>Permits will not be issued for any period less than 12 months.</p>
	<p>The permit is paperless and will be activated up to 36 hours after it has been paid for.</p>
	<h3>Cost</h3>
	<p>Green permits are free.</p>
	<h3>Time Limits</h3>
	<p>The time clock provided under the previous Green permit scheme is no longer required to be displayed.</p>
	<p>There are no time limits for parking in pay and display bays on street with a green permit. Car parks tend not to
	    have special time limits for green permits, but there are some where you can only stay for 6 hours. The following
	    car parks are restricted to a maximum stay period of 6 hours for green permit holders:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Wellington Street car park (old fire station site)</li>
	    <li>Carver Lane car park</li>
	    <li>Stanley Lane car park</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Green permits cannot be used:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>In non-council car parks or in other parking permit zones like Broomhill and Hillsborough.</li>
	    <li>In the Science Car Park A car park, Monday to Friday from 8am to 4pm.</li>
	    <li>At all Sheffield Hallam University ‘Permit Holders only’ car parks - these are indicated by yellow signs.</li>
	</ul>
	<title>Langsett and Hillsborough Bus and Tram Gate</title>
	<h3>About the Permit</h3>
	<p>A permit to drive through the bus or tram gate at Langsett Road (outbound only) is available for residents of the
	    following roads:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Rudyard Road</li>
	    <li>Rudyard Mews</li>
	    <li>Treswell Crescent</li>
	    <li>Rider Road</li>
	    <li>Haggard Road</li>
	    <li>Kipling Road</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each 'permit of exemption' is valid for 12 months. Without a permit, residents can't use the bus or tram gate. The
	    bus or tram gate on Langsett Road is just beyond Ripley Street.</p>
	<p>The permit doesn't allow the holder to use other bus/tram gates in Hillsborough or elsewhere in Sheffield. This
	    includes the ‘inbound’ bus or tram gates on Holme Lane or Middlewood Road. If holders do (when signs say they
	    shouldn't), we may consider withdrawing the exemption completely.</p>
	<p>We can provide exemptions for additional vehicles registered at individual properties (subject to appropriate
	    evidence). However, we are not able to provide exemptions for visitors to properties, delivery vehicles, or
	    short-term hire or ‘lease’ cars (unless registered at an address on one of the above roads).</p>

	<h3>Penalty Charge Notice</h3>
	<h3>Payment Enquiries</h3>
	<h3>Making a Payment</h3>
	<p>It is quick, safe, and secure to make a payment online or using our automated telephone payment line. To do this,
	    you will need:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Ticket reference number (can be found on Gateway)</li>
	    <li>Credit or debit card</li>
	    <li>Your vehicle registration number</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Alternatively, you can:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Pay at a pay point outlet by cash</li>
	    <li>Pay at a Post Office by cash, cheque, credit, or debit card</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sheffield does not accept cash, cheque, or postal orders direct.</p>
	<h3>Confirmation of Payment</h3>
	<p>Payments can take up to 3-4 days to show on our system regardless of the payment method.</p>
	<p>If the customer has received further correspondence from Parking Services asking for a payment but:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>They believe payment has already been made</li>
	    <li>Gateway is not showing case is fully paid (closed)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The customer should make a written appeal online or in writing (ideally online as it will be processed quicker)
	    and send proof of payment. If a card payment was made, the last 4 digits of the card should be provided.</p>
	<h3>Customer unable to pay</h3>
	<p>If the ticket has been allocated to Enforcement Agents (bailiffs), Parking Services are no longer responsible for
	    collecting the debt and therefore any enquiries relating to payment should be referred directly to the
	    enforcement agents involved.</p>
	<p>At this stage, only payment will be accepted, and routes to appeal have been exhausted.</p>
	<p>The enforcement agent may be able to arrange a payment agreement.</p>
	<p>Parking Services already offer a reduced rate if paid within 14 days. They do not offer payment agreements. In
	    exceptional circumstances, they may be able to extend the time the customer has to pay, but this will be at the
	    full amount.</p>
	<h3>Customer tried to pay online but won't accept details</h3>
	<p>The PCN should show on Gateway/online within minutes of being issued, therefore the customer may have incorrect
	    details. The ticket details can be confirmed on Gateway.</p>
	<p>The VRM should be entered without spaces along with the full PCN number.</p>
	<p>Check the person entering the details has entered the VRM without spaces and entered the full PCN number.</p>

	<h3>Challenging a PCN</h3>
	<h3>How can I appeal</h3>
	<p>Challenges can be made online within 28 days of receiving the original ticket. Please note that it may take up to
	    24 hours for the ticket to appear on the online portal.</p>
	<p>Documentation can be uploaded to support the challenge. The online link also enables the motorist to use an
	    interactive portal to guide them through their appeal. Evidence such as photos of the contravention can be
	    viewed online.</p>
	<p>Do not discuss any possible outcomes or give your opinions. Parking services will contact the customer following
	    the decision.</p>
	<h3>How long do I have to appeal</h3>
	<p>Anyone wanting to appeal should do so within 28 days after the original ticket was received.</p>
	<h3>Will I get a discounted rate if I appeal</h3>
	<p>If the appeal is declined, we will usually re-offer a 14 day discount period if the challenge was received whilst
	    the case is still in the initial 14 day discount period.</p>
	<p>If the charge is already at the full amount and a Notice to Owner letter has been received, there is a further 28
	    days to appeal to us online (usually the discount rate would not be offered again but this will be confirmed
	    when a written reply is sent).</p>
	<p>If the challenge is at charge certificate stage the call should be transferred to parking services (this can be
	    checked on gateway).</p>
	<h3>Have you received my appeal</h3>
	<p>This can be found by checking Gateway.</p>
	<h3>Multiple PCN's</h3>
	<p>Challenges can be made online within 28 days of receiving the original ticket. (It can take up to 24 hours to
	    appear on online portal.) </p>
	<p>Documentation can be uploaded to support the challenge, the online link also enables the motorist to use an
	    interactive portal to guide them through their appeal and evidence can be viewed (e.g photos of the
	    contravention)</p>
	<p>Do not discuss any possible outcomes or give your opinions. Parking services will contact the customer following
	    the decision.</p>
	<h3>Rejected PCN's</h3>
	<p>The correspondence to reject their challenge will explain the next steps to take if they are unhappy with the
	    decision.</p>
	<p>General information relating to the PCN Enforcement is available on the
	    <a href="http://www.patrol-uk.info">http://www.patrol-uk.info</a>
	<h3>Enforcement (Bailiff) Enquiries</h3>
	<p>Once the debt has been referred to enforcement agents there is no further investigation or challenges that can be
	    made. </p>
	<p>To make a payment or arrange an agreement to pay, the customer should contact the appropriate enforcement agency.
	</p>
	<p>If the customer states they moved address before any correspondence was sent out then refer them to Traffic
	    Regulation Centre(TFC) - TFC will provide information how to appeal.</p>

	    <li>Permit zones</li>
	    <li>Dropped kerb</li>

	<h3>Vehicle Obstruction</h3>
	<p>Refers to a vehicle causing an obstruction that is considered to be a hazard to other road or footpath users
	    where there are no parking restrictions in place. For example:</p>

	<h3>Bay Suspensions</h3>
	<h3>Requesting a Suspension</h3>
	<p>A request can be made that specific parking bays, for example pay and display, permit holders only, disabled and
	    loading bays are kept clear of parked vehicles in certain circumstances such as:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>Maintenance of adjacent property where highway access is required for deliveries, essential vehicles, skips
		etc.</li>
	    <li>Skips on the highway</li>
	    <li>Maintenance of trees</li>

	    <li>Security reasons</li>
	    <li>Filming - contact us about filming in the city</li>
	    <li>Any other reason accepted by ourselves</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Parking Services will not suspend bays to provide parking for vehicles unless they are essential for works in the
	    suspended area (such as an asbestos removal vehicle).</p>
	<p>Other works or private vehicles should be parked legally elsewhere (for example in nearby pay and display
	    parking).</p>
	<h3>Submitting your application</h3>
	<p>Applications for parking bay suspensions should be made at least 14 days before the suspension start date.</p>
	<h3>Charges and payment</h3>
	<p>If the application is accepted, Parking Services will contact the customer for payment.</p>
	<p>Full payment must be made at least 9 days before the suspension start date. You can pay by credit card, debit
	    card, or BACS.</p>

	    administration fee of £25. The daily charge per 5m section of bay is £5 for all other areas, with a
	    non-refundable administration fee of £25.</p>
	<h3>Yellow Line Dispensations</h3>
	<h3>Request Yellow Line Dispensation</h3>

	    vehicle where there is equipment which needs to be used directly from the vehicle as part of the work being
	    carried out at an adjacent property) to park on yellow lines, or in bays for longer than restrictions allow.</p>
	<h3>Dispensations are unlikely to be granted if:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>A loading ban applies</li>
	    <li>The vehicle is likely to cause an obstruction to traffic flow</li>
	    <li>The vehicle may be hazardous to other road users</li>
	</ul>

    <p>A green parking permit is for ultra low-emission vehicles (ULEV). A ULEV is any electric or hybrid vehicle that emits less than 75g of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre travelled, with a capability of travelling a minimum range of 10 miles with zero CO2 emissions.</p> 
    <p>A green permit allows you to park in pay and display on-street bays in the city centre or in Council city car parks.</p> 
    <p>The scheme is for anyone with an eligible vehicle, irrespective of home address but If you do not comply with the conditions of the scheme you may receive a parking fine.</p> 
    <p>Permits will not be issued for any period less than 12 months.</p> 
    <p>The permit is paperless and will be activated up to 36 hours after it has been paid for.</p> 
 
    <h2>Cost</h2> 
    <p>Green permits are free.</p> 
 
    <h2>Time Limits</h2> 
   <p>The time clock provided under the previous Green permit scheme is no longer required to be displayed.</p> 
    <p>There are no time limits for parking in pay and display bays on street with a green permit.

    <p>Each 'permit of exemption' is valid for 12 months. Without a permit, residents can't use the bus or tram gate. The bus or tram gate on Langsett Road is just beyond Ripley Street.</p>

    <p>We can provide exemptions for additional vehicles registered at individual properties (subject to appropriate evidence). However, we are not able to provide exemptions for visitors to properties, delivery vehicles, or short-term hire or ‘lease’ cars (unless registered at an address on one of the above roads).</p>

    <h2>How can I appeal</h2> 
    
    <p>Challenges can be made online within 28 days of receiving the original ticket. Please note that it may take up to 24 hours for the ticket to appear on the online portal.</p> 
    <p>Documentation can be uploaded to support the challenge. The online link also enables the motorist to use an interactive portal to guide them through their appeal. Evidence such as photos of the contravention can be viewed online.</p>

	<p>If the charge is already at the full amount and a Notice to Owner letter has been received, there is a further 28 days to appeal to us online (usually the discount rate would not be offered again but this will be confirmed when a written reply is sent).</p> 
	<p>If the challenge is at charge certificate stage the call should be transferred to parking services (this can be checked on gateway).</p> 
    <h2>Have you received my appeal</h2>
