      <h3>If you have changed your address or school</h3>
      <p>
        This could affect the distance your child travels to school, so please check your eligibility before you apply for a new Zoom Zero travel pass.
        <br><br>
        Applications should be made to the Council where you live and not where the school is.
        <br><br>
        If you chose not to apply for your catchment school or the three nearest qualifying secondary 
        schools for low-income families, you are unlikely to qualify for a Zoom Zero travel pass.
        <br><br>
        Please be aware that if the catchment school or nearest school(s) has a 
        place available in your child's year group, you are unlikely to qualify for 
        a Zoom Zero travel pass. There may also be exceptional circumstances 
        that could qualify your child for a Zoom Zero travel pass.

    </section>
    <p>
      Your child may be eligible for free school travel if you meet certain conditions.

    <h3>Who can apply</h3>
    <p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 miles or more, if they're 5 to 7 years old</li>
        <li>3 miles or more if they're 8 to 16 years old</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you get the maximum Working Tax Credit or your children are entitled to Free School Meals, 
      they'll get free school travel support if they are:

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>aged 8 to 11 and travel 2 miles or more to their nearest available school</li>
        <li>aged 11 to 16 and travel between 2 and 6 miles to their school, (as long as there are not 3 or more nearer available schools)</li>
        <li>aged 11 to 16 and travel between 2 and 15 miles to their nearest available school if the parent chose the school on the grounds of religion, belief</li>

          Request a Stage 1 review within 20 working days of our decision to refuse a Zoom Zero travel pass. We'll send you a
          detailed written outcome, we aim to do this within 20 working days of receiving your written request.

          challenge it in writing. This begins a Stage 2 Appeal.
        </p>
        <h4>Stage 2</h4>

              may include a route that involves footpaths, bridleways, and other pathways,
              as well as some recognised roads. A route will be viewed as ‘available’ even
