      Under the Regulatory Reform Order (2005), landlords are required to ensure
      that fire risk assessments are carried out in any shared areas of any
      properties they manage. Landlords also need to ensure that any fire escape
      routes and entrances/exits to properties are clear from trip hazards and items
      which would prevent exit from the building in the event of an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>As such, please do not place in the communal area, items such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chairs and tables</li>
      <li>Bookcases</li>

        Motorbikes, mopeds or any other equipment which uses petrol/diesel or gas
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If any of these items, or any other item which is felt to be a fire risk, are
      left in your communal area we will ask residents to remove them. If they
      remain they will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bicycles, prams, pushchairs and similar items will not normally be permitted
      to be stored or located within the internal communal parts unless there is an
      area capable of storage without causing obstruction.

                <p>This only affects people of working age, so if you are old enough to receive a state pension (of a pensionable age) then these changes will not affect you.

      <p>It is difficult to tell if something contains asbestos just by looking at it, unless it is labelled. If in doubt, you should assume that a material contains asbestos until it is confirmed otherwise. The only way to be absolutely sure is by getting it tested in a laboratory.

  <h3>What is CO Poisoning?</h3>
  <p>
    Unsafe gas appliances can produce a highly poisonous gas called carbon monoxide (CO). 
    It can cause death as well as serious long-term health problems such as brain damage. 
    CO is produced by the incomplete burning of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
    This happens when a gas appliance has been incorrectly fitted, badly repaired, or poorly maintained. 
    It can also occur if flues, chimneys, or vents are blocked. Oil and solid fuels such as coal, wood, petrol, 
    and oil can also produce carbon monoxide.
  </p>

  <h3>Remember the Six Main Symptoms to Look Out For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Dizziness</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Breathlessness</li>
    <li>Collapse</li>
    <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What to Do if You Suspect CO Poisoning?</h3>
  <p>
    Get fresh air immediately. Open doors and windows, turn off gas appliances and leave the house. 
    See your doctor immediately or go to the hospital - let them know that you suspect CO poisoning. 
    They can do a blood or breath test to check.
  </p>

      <li>Once the system has been installed, the entrance doors are locked, and access into the block will be controlled.</li>
      <li>Residents can access the block through the main door using either a door key or electronic fob.</li>
      <li>Tradespeople can access the block at certain times of the day using a push button on the door intercom panel marked as “trades.”</li>
      <li>A visitor presses the call button for the flat they wish to visit. The handset in your flat will ring for a set period of time. When you answer the call, you can have a conversation with the visitor. If you then want to allow the person in, you can press the button on the handset to release the lock on the main entrance door.</li>
      <li>If you do not want to let the visitor in, you can replace the handset and finish the call.</li>

      If this happens, you can turn off the handset using the “privacy button.” When this is used, a red light will illuminate on the phone to show that the door entry calls are switched off. The privacy facility resets itself after a fixed period of time (red light goes off) so that the handset isn’t left switched off and a genuine visitor is prevented from contacting the resident they wish to visit.

    You are responsible for repairs within your own flat or home, and should make your own arrangements for these.
    If you, or someone you have employed, are carrying out repairs inside your flat, 
    you must make sure that no damage is done to communal areas or to the structure of the building.

    Sheffield City Council will continue to carry out all external fabric and communal/shared 
    repairs to the block in which you live. You do not have the authority to carry out repairs in shared areas, 
    and you would not be covered by Sheffield City Council insurance if you had an accident or caused any damage. 
    Only Sheffield City Council may carry out this type of work.<br><br>

    Leaseholders receive a service charge bill each year for their proportion of the cost of carrying out external fabric

    <ul>
      <li>Aims to modernize electrical standards in council-managed housing by 2024.</li>
      <li>Will cover over 20,000 dwellings with potential investments of £40-45 million.</li>
      <li>Includes upgrades such as installation of isolation switches, replacement of consumer units, improved socket spread, smoke alarms, and carbon monoxide detectors.</li>
      <li>Work will be conducted in batches of 250-300 properties with a target of 60 completed properties per week.</li>
    </ul>

    <details class="details-accordion">
      <summary>Background</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>Installation of fences is the tenant’s responsibility.
        Over the last 12 years considerable investment has been made in the housing stock via the Decent Homes programme and other programmes. This has included some elements of electrical work particularly within bathrooms and kitchens. However, enhancing the overall electrical standard in homes / communal facilities was not a key requirement of the Decent Homes programme or for properties to achieve the government decent homes standard.</p>

        <p>Consequently, whilst the electrical condition of the stock is fair / good, there remain improvements required to provide a modern-day standard that will keep customers safe, contribute to digital inclusion, meet existing and future legislative standards and contribute to reducing the carbon footprint by providing energy efficient products.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details class="details-accordion">
      <summary>What will be included within the Electrical Upgrade Programme?</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>The aim of this programme is to bring all properties over time up to a modern-day electrical standard and move towards an electrical periodic test every 5 years as recommended by the National Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC).</p>

        <p>Work will be released in batch orders of approximately 250 to 300 dwellings but on a geographical basis to enable the contractor(s) and the contract administrator to work efficiently. Once fully underway, 60 properties per week for each contractor will be completed. This programme will include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Install Isolation Switch (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Carry out an initial periodic condition test and report</li>
          <li>Replace consumer units (where necessary only) to provide improved RCD protection and safety for residents</li>
          <li>Address Category 1, 2, and 3 issues identified by the periodic test</li>
          <li>Ensure earth bonding is adequate (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Install earth wiring to lighting circuits (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Install additional sockets and/or improve the spread of sockets including 2 USB equipped sockets</li>
          <li>Install hard-wired smoke alarms</li>
          <li>Install carbon monoxide detectors – risk-based approach</li>
          <li>Replace bathroom light fittings which are difficult to access to replace bulbs</li>
          <li>Install external lighting to houses, bungalows & flats (where no communal lighting presently exists)</li>
          <li>Carry out a final periodic test (if further work is carried out) to verify all electrics are operating correctly</li>
          <li>Not every dwelling will require all the above work.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The list above is a menu of activity which will be undertaken as required.</p>

        <p>Isolation switches allow the dwelling to be worked upon safely by electrical engineers. During the Decent Homes programme, thousands of isolation switches were installed, but we do not have full coverage. The upgrade project will enable us over time to install an isolation switch to every property.</p>

        <p>Consumer unit specifications change regularly, and in certain cases, we are not offering the most ideal protection. This project will ensure consumer units are suitable, up-to-date, and offer the best protection to our residents.</p>

        <p>Category 1 & 2 issues identified from the periodic test will be rectified. Category 3 issues will be rectified based on a cost/benefit analysis.</p>

        <p>Earth bonding is very often disrupted as a result of other works. This project will ensure that earth bonding is maintained and is effective.</p>

        <p>Earth wiring to lighting circuits will be installed, enabling residents to use metal lighting accessories safely. At present, metal accessories have to be removed if found for Health & Safety reasons.</p>

      <summary>Meeting Modern Day Standards - Additional Sockets and/or spread of sockets</summary>
      <div class="details-accordion-content">
        <p>Due to the age of the stock many of the dwellings do not have sufficient sockets or a sufficient spread of sockets which meet customer needs and the increasing use of technology in the home which leads to the overuse of trailing cables or socket extension leads. This can lead to Health and Safety issues. The Decent Homes programme did provide some improvements especially in kitchens but there is still work to do in many dwellings to improve the socket provision. There is no current programme to cover this work.</p>

        <p>Evidence from the teams working on the ground indicates that customer DIY work to electrics is putting residents at risk. For example, the erection of external lighting in response to security concerns, additional sockets not installed by a qualified installer, surface mounted sockets and trailing cables.</p>

        <p>Hard Wired Smoke Alarms - There is around 10,000 hard wired smoke alarms within the stock. All high risk properties such as sheltered, and towers have hard wired smoke alarms with the exception of Deer Park tower blocks. This block needs to be addressed ASAP in response to recommendations from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</p>

        <p>Additionally properties that are rewired always have hard wired alarms installed at the same time as it is part of the rewire specification. Legislation does not currently insist we install hard wired to all dwellings managed by Housing Services, but it may do in near future as there is national lobbying to government by the Fire Service. Hard wired alarms are part of the building regulations for new build. In the meantime, we have battery smoke alarms within the remaining stock which are checked annually by the gas and district heating servicing programmes.</p>

        <p>Carbon Monoxide Detectors - There are very few carbon monoxide detectors within the stock as a whole. Once again, the legislation surrounding carbon monoxide detectors does not insist on their use but increasingly there is recommendation for their use in general housing stock. Carbon Monoxide detectors are part of the building regulations for new build. It is recommended that the housing service installs Carbon Monoxide detectors on a risk-based approach at the same time as other electrical improvement work and / or when hard wired smoke alarms are installed. There is no current programme.</p>

        <p>Replacing bathroom light fittings which are difficult to access – since the new requirement for bathroom light fittings were introduced approx.10 to 12 years ago tenants have had difficulty removing the cover and changing the light bulbs. Some of the fittings are particularly difficult to access. This programme will identify these fittings and replace with a more suitable unit. The unit will be LED.</p>

        <p>External Lighting – A report from Birmingham University presented to the Burglary Theme Group in 2014 provided evidence that external lighting can reduce the incidence of burglary and is the most effective of all the crime reduction measures that can be applied to a home including burglar alarms. Including this work as part of an upgrade project will present tenants with a safer environment in which to live.</p>

      The District Heating Meter location may vary but is usually located in the property airing cupboard. Does The Meters Home Screen say ON in the top right corner? Is your heating programmer turned on?
    </li>
    <li>  
      To activate an emergency credit, press the blue button, marked ‘Press For Em Credit’ as instructed by the meters home screen. 
      This will allow the tenant to ‘borrow’ credit up to £10.00 which will connect your heat and hot water supply for a short time. 
      This is simply a loan and will need to be repaid on receipt of the prepayment information/number which will be with them shortly.<br>
      <strong>Advisor note</strong>: If the tenant has already reached the £10.00 limit and needs additional funds they can contact the Home Ownership and Revenues Team on: <a href="tel:0114 2735595">0114 2735595</a>.
      This is a public number and has voicemail if the team is unavailable. They can also be contact by email at: <a href="mailto:RDH@Sheffield.gov.uk">RDH@Sheffield.gov.uk</a>

      If the Meters screen in blank or shows something similar to ‘D bug’ then the customer can reboot the G6 unit by pressing the blue and orange button together for 10 seconds.

    All Council Housing Service staff, surveyors, and contractors carry identification cards at all times. It is important that you always ask to see identification before you let anyone into your home. If you have any doubts about a caller’s identity, do not let them in.
    <br><br>
    Council Officers NEVER ask a household for cash on the doorstep. You should always be alert to protect yourself against bogus callers. If you are suspicious about any caller’s identity, you should call the police immediately.

    Give the option to search for team contact details and to report by case (but remind to phone the police).

  "Guidelines for housing benefit claims in scenarios like dual liabilities, fleeing violence, delayed occupation, or hospitalisation.",
  `
      <h4>Unavoidable liability</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> When tenants sign for a tenancy and have moved in but have a liability on another property.</p>
      <p>This is where a tenant has signed for a Council property but has a liability at another property. 
        This usually occurs when they have to give four weeks' notice on the property 
        they have left but are inclined to take the Council Housing Service property.</p>
      <p>To make a claim for unavoidable liability, a written request needs to be made by the tenant. 
        As it is discretionary, they will then need to satisfy the criteria 
        as stated on the enclosed letter within the standard 28 days of the application. 
        For housing benefit to be paid on the Council Housing Service property, 
        the tenants will need to be physically living at the property. 
        If not, housing benefit cannot be paid under unavoidable liability rules.</p>
  
      <h4>Fleeing violence</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Where a tenant is fleeing violence and has been put into other accommodation.</p>
      <p>If someone is fleeing violence, and they state that they have an intention to return home if the threat of violence is lifted, 
        then they can claim housing benefit on two homes if they have a rental liability at 
        the property they are fleeing and the one that they are currently occupying.</p>
      <p>They will need to complete a housing benefit claim for both homes.</p>
      <p>To successfully claim housing benefit, they will need to confirm in writing that they have an intention 
        to return to the property once the threat of violence is removed. 
        They may also need to provide proof, such as a letter from the police, 
        a crime reference number, or a letter from the Council Housing Service.</p>
  
      <h4>Benefit prior to occupation</h4>
      <p><strong>Basic principles:</strong> Benefit prior to occupation can only be paid when housing benefit is <u>not</u> being paid at any other property.</p>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Tenant(s) sign for a property but there is a delay in moving into the property.</p>
      <p>A tenant(s) may qualify for up to four weeks of benefit prior to occupation if the delay in moving was 
        reasonable and they were waiting for a social fund payment for a need connected with the move (e.g., removal expenses or help to set up home). 
        This only applies if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They have a child of five or under living with them.</li>
        <li>They are 60 or over and neither they nor their partner are receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA).</li>
        <li>They are under 60 (or they or their partner are receiving IS or JSA) and qualify for one of the pensioner premiums or 
          a disability, severe disability, or disabled child premium.</li>
        <li>They were waiting for adaptations to be completed to meet needs due to a disability (must be structural, not decorative).</li>
        <li>They became liable for payments while a hospital patient or in residential accommodation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Housing benefit is not paid until the tenants move in, and they should have already informed the local authority (LA) of their intent to move. 
        A new claim must be made within four weeks of the actual move-in date.</p>
      <p>If the above criteria are not met, then a tenant will not be able to claim housing benefit until they move in.</p>
      <p>You will need to inform the tenant that if they do not move in and do not meet the above criteria, 
        they will be liable for full rent until they move into the property.</p>
  
      <h4>In hospital</h4>
      <p>If a tenant is in hospital during the time they have signed up for the property, 
        they will not be entitled to housing benefit until they actually move into the property.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, it can be argued that they have moved the majority of their possessions into the 
        property and that this is their main home (as per the basic principles). 
        However, this does not apply if they have a property elsewhere.</p>

    <p>
      If you live in an ex-Council flat or maisonette property you are a leaseholder
      of Sheffield City Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a landlord, the Council are responsible for calculating and issuing bills to leaseholders.
      These may be for service charges and similar costs, as well as for major works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council are only responsible for communal repairs; Leaseholders are responsible
      for repairs within their own property.
    </p>
    <h3>What service charges cover</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges cover all works and services carried out to the structure of the block and communal
      areas, including cleaning of communal areas, lighting, lift maintenance and upkeep of gardens. It also
      covers day-to-day repairs, maintenance and improvement work.
    </p>
    <h3>Cost of service charges</h3>
    <p>
      Service charges for leaseholders are paid annually and vary depending on the cost incurred to the
      block during the service charge year, which runs from 1st October to 30th September. Customers will
      pay a share of the costs calculated for their block. For example; if there are 8 dwellings in a block,
      service charges will amount to 1/8th of the total cost.
    </p>
    <h3>Difficulty paying service charge</h3>
    <p>
      Leaseholders can now pay service charges by instalments, spreading the cost over 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      For larger items of work commanding higher costs, Leaseholders should contact the Council to discuss tailored repayment options.
    </p>
    <h3>Subletting a property</h3>
    <p>
      As a leaseholder you have the right to sublet your home. This means that you may take in lodgers or rent your home to someone else, if you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also need to advise your mortgage lender if you do rent out your home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will remain responsible for ensuring that the terms of the lease are complied with and you will remain liable for any breaches,
      regardless of whether the breaches are committed by you, your sub-tenant or other parties connected to your sub-tenant.
      You will therefore be responsible for the behaviour of your sub-tenant(s). This would include, for example, ensuring that they do not cause a nuisance to neighbours.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact Details</h3>
    <p>
      The leaseholder team can be contacted via <a href="tel:0114 2734468">0114 2734468</a> and <a href="mailto:leaseholdservice@sheffield.gov.uk">leaseholdservice@sheffield.gov.uk</a>.

  "Check eligibility for Sheffield's Housing Register, including age, immigration status, and documentation requirements for application.",
  `
      <p>
        Sheffield City Council operates an open register and therefore any person over
        the age of 16 can apply to join the Housing Register. However, generally you
        will not be made an offer of a property until you are at least 18 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Housing Act 1996 prevents Local Authorities from offering a property to
        some people because of their immigration status. We will let you know if this
        applies to you after you register.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are eligible to register you may do so by completing the online
        application form. Following this, you will be provided with a login reference
        number and required to provide a memorable date which will act as your
        password for logging in to the website in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some people who are not eligible to be included on the Housing
        Register. These are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain people who are subject to Immigration Control under the 1996 Asylum
        and Immigration Act.
        <br />
        Certain people from abroad who are not subject to immigration control but who
        are not habitually resident in the UK, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or
        the Republic of Ireland.
        <br />
        People (including members of their household) who have been guilty of
        unacceptable behaviour that makes them unsuitable to be a tenant.
      </p>
      <h3>After submitting your application</h3>
      <p>
        After submitting your application online you will be asked to provide us with
        various documentation such as identification and a reference. You may also be
        asked to provide evidence of your immigration status where relevant. You
        should make sure that all of this documentation is available to you before
        completing your online application as you need to submit this
        documentation immediately. Failure to provide this within the given timescales
        will mean you will need to restart the process from the beginning by
        submitting a further online application.
      </p>
      <h3>Eligibility Table</h3>
      <p>
        A copy of the eligibility table can be found 
        <a href="https://sccextranet.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/CustomerServiceKnowledgeCouncilHousing/EbdSLAAvW9JGiy9NqU1kK10B4dnbAzvX4hi3YjglwR3TDQ?e=Nicw6D&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiI0OS8yNDEwMjAwMTMxOCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Relaxed eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Relaxed eligibility criteria is uncommon, but has sometimes been applied in
        the past to properties that receive no bids and/or have a known low demand.
        The majority of these properties were maisonettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properties where relaxed eligibility has been applied will have a message in
        the 'Show full details>>Further information' box of the property advert.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Example: A 3 bed maisonette with relaxed eligibility will have a message
        similar to this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Households eligible for 2 bed properties can bid and a financial assessment
        will be carried out to check that the property is affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a customer then places a bid for the property and comes first, IMFIT
        (Rents) will contact the customer prior to any offer to ensure that the
        customer is able to afford the property.

  <p> Social Services will undertake an initial visit to assess the size of the applicant’s current accommodation.

     <p>Fostering has a different process. 
     Until an applicant is suitably housed an assessment cannot begin. 
     Confirmation from Social Services in the form of an email stating the applicant has made an application to foster is the requirement 
     to change bedroom eligibility. Upon receipt of confirmation, the bedroom eligibility can be amended. 
     An e-mail from Social Services will be the normal route to receive confirmation. 
     However staff advising potential foster carers must advise the applicant of the benefit implications of moving to a 
     larger property if the child / children are not placed with them immediately after they move or they do not proceed with the 
     application to foster after they are rehoused.</p>

                We hold separate waiting lists for our Extra Care schemes at White Willows and the Meadows. These lists are not currently suspended.
                People can apply directly to the services if they don’t need care.
                The PL for both these schemes is Chris Dearnley:<a href="c.dearnely@syha.co.uk" target="_blank">c.dearnely@syha.co.uk</a>  (0114 244 4978).
                If care is needed, then they go through the link workers. The link workers for the schemes are Jean Peachey for The Meadows (<a href="jean.peachey@sheffield.gov.uk" target="_blank">jean.peachey@sheffield.gov.uk</a>) and Jacqui Bradshaw for White Willows (<a href="Jacqueline.bradshaw@sheffield.gov.uk" target="_blank">Jacqueline.bradshaw@sheffield.gov.uk</a>).

        ID is required for all Household Members and should be submitted within 28 days of filling-in 
        the Application.<br><br>
  
        Applicants should present the relevant documents at a Housing Office or First Point where the

        Customers should not post original documents to us, but when a customer has posted their documents to us,
        they should call to advise us of this. Advisor Note: The Registrations Team need to be advised so they
        can check DMS in the next couple of days and subsequently validate the application. <br>
        Remember to take a note of the names and dates of birth of all household members and include them

  "Moving In",
  "Details about moving into a new property, including scheduling, property standards, utility setup, and meter readings.",
  `
      <h4>When can I move in once offered a property?</h4>
      <p>
        You can arrange your moving in date as part of the viewing and Sign Up process 
        with the <strong>Voids</strong> Officer.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Standard of property when moving in</h4>
      <p>
        Before you move into your new home we will check to make sure it is safe and secure. 
        Where necessary we get qualified and skilled trades people to test electrical, gas, 
        water and waste services. Our priority is to provide you with a safe living environment. 
        We will ensure that:<br><br>
  
        Sometimes delays may occur due to unforeseen work that is required to bring the property up
        to a standard that meets our Vacant Charter.  
        When the property is ready, we will contact you to arrange an appointment to view the property 
        and then to sign for your new tenancy, should you choose to accept. In some circumstances 
        we may arrange a ‘work in progress’ viewing.<br><br>
  
        Generally, if repairs are left outstanding at the start of a tenancy, these would be minor ones 
        not seriously affecting the use of the property and would require a small amount of work to rectify 
        the given problems. To have completed these within the prior repairs programme/work schedule 
        would have unnecessarily held up the letting, leaving a property standing ‘idle’ whilst there were 
        people needing re-housing. The ‘on-tenancy’ repairs can be completed once you have moved in 
        and will cause very little in the way of disruption, mess or upheaval.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Gas / Electricity supplier</h4>
      <p>
        Any known utilities suppliers information will be provided in the Sign-up pack.
  
        The responsibility/contractual agreement for arranging the supply 
        (and the utility meter installation if necessary) is with the customer and 
        the utility provider e.g. British Gas, Powergen etc.<br><br>
  
        If the supplier is not known, the customer will need to contact one of the numbers below, 
        and then contact the utility supplier themselves:<br><br>
  
        <strong>Gas</strong> - Call the M Number Enquiry Line on <a href="tel:0870 6081524">0870 6081524</a>, provided by xoserve Ltd. 
        They will tell you the supplier and give you your Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN).<br><br>
  
        <strong>Electricity</strong> - Call your local electricity distribution company and ask for their Meter 
        Point Administration Service (MPAS). Alternatively, contact <a href="tel:00845 0707172">0845 0707172</a>.
      </p>
  
      <h4>Meter Readings</h4>
      <p>
        The meter reading before they moved in - you will have been advised of this at sign up 
        and the information will have been provided in their sign up pack. (We also advise Customers 
        to take their own meter readings and contact the utility company themselves.)<br><br>
  
        The meter reading when they move out - you should contact the utility company themselves.

              <ul>
                <li>You have an introductory tenancy or another type of tenancy that is not Secure or Assured.</li>

                <li>The tenancy is subject to a notice seeking possession or possession proceedings are pending.</li>
                <li>The tenant or a household member is subject to any court order or any proceedings are pending in respect of antisocial behaviour.</li>
                <li>The property is substantially larger than you and your family need.</li>
                <li>The property is too small for you and your family and would result in overcrowding or would break the normal letting criteria in relation to the size of the property and the number of occupants.</li>
                <li>The property has been let as a service tenancy.</li>
                <li>The property has been adapted for a person with a physical disability and is very different from other properties and if the exchange were to go ahead, a disabled person would no longer live in the property.</li>
                <li>The property is one of a group let to people with special needs near to Social Services or a special facility and if the exchange was to go ahead someone needing those services or facilities would no longer be living in the property. This includes sheltered or supported housing schemes and properties normally offered to people with mobility needs.</li>
                <li>The property is the subject of a management agreement with a housing association and at least half the tenants of the properties within the agreement are members and the tenant is not willing to become a member.</li>

                The forms will then be processed by staff within the Mutual Exchange Team, who will contact you directly. 
                If anyone involved is not a Sheffield City Council tenant, paperwork will also need to be completed and returned to the other housing provider(s).

            <div class="details-accordion-content">
              <p>
                Yes. The landlord of everyone involved in the exchange must agree to it. Before we can agree, we will check that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You have a clear current rent account</li>

              <p>
                There are also rules that apply in terms of eligibility for different sizes and types of property. 
                Remember that you should not move until you have written permission from us and a move date has been agreed.

              <p>
                Mutual Exchanges are normally allowed, however, we can refuse for the following reasons only as set out in legislation:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The tenancy is subject to a court order for possession.</li>

                <li>The tenant or a household member is subject to any court order or any proceedings are pending in respect of antisocial behaviour.</li>
                <li>The property is substantially larger than you and your family need.</li>
                <li>The property is too small for you and your family and would result in overcrowding or would break the normal letting criteria in relation to the size of the property and the number of occupants.</li>
                <li>The property has been let as a service tenancy.</li>
                <li>The property has been adapted for a person with a physical disability and is very different from other properties and if the exchange were to go ahead, a disabled person would no longer live in the property.</li>
                <li>The property is one of a group let to people with special needs near to Social Services or a special facility and if the exchange was to go ahead someone needing those services or facilities would no longer be living in the property. This includes sheltered or supported housing schemes and properties normally offered to people with mobility needs.</li>
                <li>The property is the subject of a management agreement with a housing association and at least half the tenants of the properties within the agreement are members and the tenant is not willing to become a member.</li>

                It depends on the type of arrears. Only current arrears are taken into consideration. <br>
                You must have a completely clear current rent account before full consent will be given (See conditional consent above). <br>
                You will not be able to move with current arrears, even if you have been sticking to a repayment plan. <br>
                Any other types of arrears, including former tenancy arrears, recharges, etc., will be disregarded and will not prevent an exchange from taking place.<br>

                It may be illegal in some circumstances. We would advise that you should never offer or receive money to carry out a Mutual Exchange,

    <p>
      Priority for rehousing can be awarded if there is a need to be rehoused urgently and immediately. When your circumstances have been assessed, we will look at whether we can give you priority for housing ahead of other people on the Housing Register. We will then write to you explaining our decision. If we give you priority, we will explain why it has been given, what sort of property it is for and how long you have to use it. The letter will also explain how to request a review of the decision if you are unhappy with it.<br><br>
  
      In some cases we will make you an offer of a property that we feel meets your needs. If we are unable to contact you due to changes not notified to us, your registration may be suspended or cancelled.<br><br>
  
      If you may be eligible for a priority you will be asked to provide us with further information. Once you have been assessed, we will write to you and explain whether you have been given priority. If you are given priority the letter will explain what sort of properties you can bid for with the priority and when the priority will be reviewed.<br><br>
  
      We will write to you and explain why if you have not been awarded a priority. We will tell you if you can request a review of the decision and how to go about this. In many cases, if you are not given priority but need further assistance, we will work with you, your advocates and our partner agencies to provide advice and assistance.<br><br>
  
      A priority does not affect your waiting time, you can apply for properties with both your waiting time and your priority. For most of the properties advertised we will consider people with priority first. If you have a priority, you must keep bidding for suitable properties. Even with a priority, you may have to bid for a considerable time before you are offered a property. In order for our system to be fair, a proportion of properties are also let on the basis of an applicant's waiting time on the housing register. This will be clearly shown in the property adverts.<br>

      <h3>Priority Banding Table</h3>
  
      <p>The table below shows the list of priorities and the bands they fall in. </p>
  
      <p>Some of the priorities span multiple bands and we cannot give a definitive answer for which band they will be in e.g. demolition and health. 
      As such, these are marked in the table below as ‘None’. </p>
  
      <p>Also marked as ‘None’ are the priorities which no longer exist. These are: </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Council Service tenant retiring or leaving employment</li>
        <li>Council service tenant who is dismissed</li>
        <li>Special Case</li>
        <li>If a priority spans the bands, the awarding officer will have already spoken with the customer.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Effective Dates</h3>
  
      <p>Within bands A-D there is no hierarchy, offers will be made solely on the effective date within the band. For example, 
      three different priorities within the same band would be ordered based on the earliest effective date first.</p>
  
      <p>The only exception is band E which has the following hierarchy: </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>No Local Connection</li>
        <li>Refused Offers</li>
        <li>Unacceptable Behaviour </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Inside each of the above rungs, applicants are ordered based on effective date.  
      Therefore, an applicant with unacceptable behaviour in band E will always come below an applicant in band E due to refused offers 
      regardless of their effective date.</p>

      <h3>How does Sheffield City Council allocate the property?</h3>
       <p>
        Once the bidding period has closed on a Tuesday night, bids for each property are sorted automatically based on the eligibility criteria. Full details of how we allocate properties can be found in Sheffield City Council’s Allocations Policy however in short:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Properties advertised to Waiting Time – These properties will be offered to customers in band D first in order of their effective date (oldest first). If no customers in band D accept the property, it will be offered to the other bands in the following order: band A, band B, band C, Band E.</li>
        <li>Properties advertised to Housing Register – These properties will be offered to customers with a priority in band A first in order of their effective date (oldest first). If no customers in band A accept the property, it will be offered to the other bands in the following order: band B, Band C, Band D, Band E.</li>
        <li>Properties advertised to First Come First Served – These properties will be offered to the customer who placed their bid first regardless of their band or effective date. The customer must still meet the minimum eligibility requirements in order for their bid to be considered.</li>
        <li>If your bid for a property was successful, we will contact you and invite you to view the property as soon as possible. We do not contact unsuccessful applicants however; you will be able to check your final bid position on the Sheffield Property Shop. You can do this by logging in to your account.</li>
        <li>There are some circumstances where a customer may come in first position for a property however due to other circumstances such as a debt to the Housing Service or a history of anti-social behaviour, they are bypassed and are not made the offer. We will let you know if we bypass you for an offer and explain how you can rectify this.</li>
        <li>Please note, if you make a bid for a property and your circumstances change or your priority ends during the bidding period, we will not offer you the property if you no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</li>

        <p>
          Current SCC tenants are not required to submit a reference as the Council is already aware of 
          their circumstances and tenancy history.<br>
          References were introduced as part of the Allocations Policy. The purpose of this is for SCC to better 
          understand the people who are currently on its Housing Register. <br>
          SCC often has very little knowledge of the people on the register and therefore requesting a reference will help the Council to improve this.

        <p>
          All customers other than current SCC tenants now need to provide a reference when joining the Housing Register. 
          The following customers also need to provide a reference when creating a new application:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Housing Association tenants (Landlord needs to provide the reference)</li>
          <li>Tenants of other Councils (Landlord needs to provide the reference)</li>
          <li>Private rented tenants (Landlord needs to provide the reference - the landlord must not be a family member)</li>
          <li>Owner occupiers - no need for a reference as bidding is restricted</li>
          <li>Living with family/parents (18+ only, character reference is needed)</li>
          <li>NFA/Living with friends (Character reference is needed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          For customers who currently do or have ever lived independently, the reference should be completed by their most recent landlord.
          Advisor note: For customers who are unable to provide a landlord's reference, they must gain agreement from the 
          Registration Team for what reference will be acceptable and they will send the professional reference form out.<br>
          If the customer is advising that there would be a charge for the reference, the customer would be responsible for 
          this charge. SCC will not pay landlords to provide a reference.

    If a customer is in band D and they have refused 3 offers in 12 months, the Sheffield City Council Allocations Policy states:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you refuse an offer of a property, you could be moved to a lower band or your application may be cancelled. The following will also be considered as a refusal:</li>
      <li>If you fail to respond to an offer of a property made to you within the timescales specified and do not have a good reason for this failure.</li>
      <li>If you fail to attend a viewing of a property offered to you within the timescales specified and do not have a good reason for this failure.</li>
    </ul>
    If you are to be Demoted, we will write to you 21 days before you are Demoted. If you do not respond, you will be Demoted to band E on the Housing Register for 12 months. After 12 months you can request to be moved back in to band D.

     <h3>Disqualification following refusal of 3 reasonable offers</h3>
     <p>
      If a customer who is in band E refuses 3 reasonable offers, they can be disqualified from the Housing Register.<br>
      The customer will be notified in writing and they have 21 days to appeal the decision. <br>
      If we do not hear from the customer within 21 days, their housing application will be cancelled and they will be disqualified from the Housing Register for 12 months. <br>
      After 12 months the customer is able to submit an on-line application for Social Housing to re-join the Housing Register.

            The Tenants Levy is a weekly payment of 10p that is used to support community activity in our

            and Residents Associations (TARAs). Where there is currently no TARA, the levy is held by the 
            Council to support any future community activity in the local area.

        <p>
            Tenants can decide whether to pay the levy, which is not covered by Housing Benefit or Universal Credit.

    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            The Notice of Variation (NOV) letter will be posted from 15th February 2024, arriving with 
            tenants in the seven days after this.
        </p>
        <p>
            These letters are based on information produced on 8th February 2024, so any tenancy changes 
            after that won’t be included. This means any successions, assignments, changes of names, etc. 
            will be correct on the system, but the letters will be sent with the original details on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NOV letter includes the detailed rent change letter and a letter from the Housing Cabinet Member.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second letter will be posted to tenants from 18th March 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second letter includes the Gross amount letter and inserts. This second letter will show 
            all the charges on the account and WILL include the housing benefit, so it shows the net amount payable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefit details included are as of 11th March 2024, so any changes in entitlement after that 
            date won’t be shown on these rent change letters. Tenants will be notified separately by Sheffield 
            Benefits Service for any changes after 11th March 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anybody on Housing Benefit will also receive a letter directly from Sheffield Benefits Service 
            telling them what their Housing Benefit is and how it has been worked out. These letters from the
            Benefits Service will be posted to tenants from 11th March 2024. Any queries need to be made directly
            to the Sheffield Benefits service.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Water rates leaflet for properties covered by Yorkshire Water will be posted separately around 
            the same time. As before, these dates change every year.

  `
   <p>New tenants do not have to register with Switch2 when they move into their new property; 
   it is done automatically on the first Wednesday after the property is let.</p>

   <p>If a tenant gets the keys early, then there will probably be a delay with their card. 
   If this is the case, they will have to call us and we will have to set up the account 
   earlier, but we must stress: <span class="important">if there is no power on, then there 
   will be no heating, so always check this first with the customer.</span></p>

  <h3>Freehold - District Heating</h3>

  <p>If a customer has bought their property but we still maintain the district heating, 
  when logging a job on T-Mobile, start the order comments with <strong>SOLD</strong>, 
  then the description of the repair.</p>

  <h3>Advice for New Tenants Who Have Had a Heat Meter Installed</h3>

  <ul>
      <li>The heating, hot water, or the heat meter will not work until there is power on at 
      the property. So, a new tenant will have to organize this first.</li>
      <li>When the power is sorted out, the meter will be reset back to zero by the previous 
      tenant.</li>
      <li>Tenants can then press the emergency credit button, and this will give them 
      <strong>£10 emergency credit</strong> (this will have to be paid back). This will last 
      them until the account is set up and the card ordered (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Automatic Account Setup</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>When properties are let, an account will automatically be set up with Switch2 for the 
    new tenant, and a barcode will be sent by first-class post in a letter. Tenants can use 
    this barcode to top up their meter until the new payment card arrives (this usually takes 5 
    working days). This can be used at any shop with a PayPoint or Post Office.</li>
    <li>If they wish to receive the package (if it's not left in the property), they can call 
    <strong>27 35595</strong> direct and we will send one out. This package has information 
    about the heat meter and the payment options, including an application for Direct Debit.</li>

  <h3>Lost or Missing Cards</h3>

  <ul>
      <li><strong>Lost cards:</strong> Ask customers to call <strong>0333 321 2010.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Chase their meter card:</strong> Ask customers to contact Switch2 at <strong>0333 321 2010.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Payment and Suppliers</h3>

  <p>Tenants pay the council and will not be able to look for alternate suppliers.</p>
  <p>Switch2 handles our billing and accounts, and fits and maintains the meters.</p>

  <p>Inform the customer that if they are over £250 (Total Indebtedness) in arrears their Permissions 
  request is unlikely to be granted.</p>
  <p>You must have written permission from the Housing Service to alter or improve your home. 
  This includes:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Putting up any form of extension or building</li>
      <li>Adding to, changing, or replacing the fixtures, fittings and appliances provided by us.</li>
      <li>Altering essential gas, electricity, and water services</li>

  <p>It is your responsibility to seek and get any planning or building regulation approvals.</p>
  <p>Permissions for loft conversions, conservatories, spiral staircases, swimming pools and extensions 
  are highly unlikely to be granted due to extra maintenance costs and potential structural problems.</p>
  <p>It is also unlikely that we will give permissions for stairlifts in communal areas, as it is more 
  appropriate for tenants that require this to be rehoused.</p>
  <p>Every request for permission will be assessed using criteria and conditions appropriate to the request. 
  These criteria and conditions will be explained in the letter sent in reply to the customer's permission 
  request.</p>

  <p>The fault code has been missing a lot lately from the job notes as asked for in the prompt 
  text box for central heating repairs.</p>
  <p>This has meant we have had an increase of <strong>F28 / F29 faults codes</strong> (avoidable jobs).</p>
  <p>92% of the time this is a meter fault which is more common now with a smart meter i.e., 
  it's not switched on / not been reset after the tenant has run out of credit.</p>
  <p>If the customer describes this fault, please ask them to:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Check they have credit on their meter.</li>
      <li>The meter display is working.</li>
      <li>The meter is on / not shut down due to safety lock out.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If the customer answers <strong>no</strong> to any of these questions they will need to 
  add credit or contact their supplier to rectify the meter fault or they will be told how to 
  switch on/reset the meter.</p>
  <p>If the customer answers <strong>yes</strong> to all 3 questions, they simply must press 
  and hold the reset button on the boiler for 3 seconds, this button is a flame with an X 
  through it see pic below.</p>

  <img class="knowledge-img" src="https://cdn.uk.empro.verintcloudservices.com/tenants/sheffield/Images/heating-repair.png" alt="If this fails and it still goes to F28 (not F29) then it is a genuine heating repair" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
  
  <p>If this fails and it still goes to F28 (not F29), then it is a genuine heating repair:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>The gas meter has run out of gas.</li>
      <li>This is a new tenant that hasn't had the gas reinstated.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The above will apply to Vaillant boilers only. However, for the new Duo Tecs we are 
  installing in certain areas, the code <strong>E133</strong> will appear.</p>

  <p>Other than these boilers, none of the older ones will have digital displays. 
  However, you should still:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Ask the customer to check the gas meter.</li>
      <li>Check T-MOBILE to find out if the property has been recently vacant, and whether 
      a gas reinstatement was ordered.</li>

          RPIT have a program to fit around 17000 mains wiring alarm which will take about 6 to 7 
          years.
          </p>
          <p>
          R&M - HM&E are fitting a battery CO alarm on the gas service if a main's one is not 
          currently fitted in the property / correct place.
          </p>
          <p>
          We will fit a battery CO alarm if requested. (If the customer does not have one already 
          fitted or it's gone faulty)
          </p>
          <p>
          We must fit it within 28 days of the request as well, but we only have to fit them near 
          gas fires and gas boilers, not near gas cookers or gas hobs.
          </p>
          <p>
          The easy way to tell if its battery or mains wired alarm in the property is the battery 
          alarm's we are fitting are a AICO EI208, so if they can't see this model number it's most 
          likely a mains power one.
          </p>

          <p>
          As for fitting the battery alarm any trade can do them, but if the operative is not from 
          the gas section, they need to confirm with the gas section were to locate the alarm or speak 
          to <strong>AICO </strong>technical for location advice.
          </p>
          <p>
          Replacing Mains alarms is still down for electricians.

<h3>Cancel an Appointment</h3>

  <p>If a tenant rings to cancel an appointment as they have no gas, <strong>do not</strong> 
  cancel the appointment. We will still visit, and if there is no gas, we cap off. 
  This ensures that the tenant will ring back to have the appliances uncapped and serviced. 
  If we just cancel, then there is no guarantee that the tenant will ring back.</p>

<h3>New Tenant</h3>

  <p>If a new tenant makes contact regarding a gas reinstate, then these need to be passed 
  through to </p>

    window.location.hostname

  <p>if no answer please email 
  <a href="mailto:HME_GandE_Reinstates@sheffield.gov.uk">HME_GandE_Reinstates@sheffield.gov.uk</a>.</p>
  <p>If a new tenant makes contact and reports that they have no heat or hot water, please 
  first check that their gas has been reinstated <strong>before</strong> ordering a repair.</p>


<h3>Existing Tenant</h3>

  <p>As part of the annual gas service, if we arrive and the tenant has no gas on the meter, 
  we cap off the supply. We then wait for the tenant to contact us and arrange an "uncap and 
  service".</p>
  <p>If the tenant makes contact within two weeks of the original cap off, then this can be 
  put through to Gas team  direct on <a href="mailto:Gas@sheffield.gov.uk">Gas</a>.</p>
  <p>If job and it is more than two weeks, then these need to be put through to: </p>

  <p>There are occasions where a tenant may have a <strong>gas meter changed</strong>. When 
  the meter is changed, the supplier generally asks the tenant for a copy of the most 
  up-to-date service certificate.</p>
  <p>If they cannot provide this, then the supplier will cap them off. In cases like this, 
  you just need to raise a repair, on an <strong>URGENT</strong>, to "Reconnect and safety 
  check after meter change", using the "No heat / hot water code".</p>

  <p>Glazing Repairs Including Failed Double-Glazed Units</p>

<h3>Warranty</h3>

  <p>Identified from the T-Mobile system. If repair is identified as within a warranty period, 
  invoke the warranty repair process.</p>

<h3>Key questions and information</h3>

  <p>If there is a <strong>Police Crime Reference Number</strong>, Order Remedy Repair.</p>
  <p>If the glass in the window/door has gone through completely, put a board-up on straight 
  away for H&S. If only a crack or chip, tenant needs to get a crime reference number 
  1st before we put any job on.</p>
  <p>If the customer has a Crime Reference Number, you must also order a follow up re-glazing 
  job and appoint it accordingly.</p>
  <p>Please note it is not the responsibility of the joiner carrying out the board up to do it.</p>
  <p>If there is no Crime reference Number advise tenant that it would be a recharge.</p>
  <p>When ordering <strong>all</strong> double-glazing repairs, the tenant must be informed 
  that the first appointment will be to measure the unit only - it is not to carry out the 
  repair.</p>
  <p>As all double-glazed units are individually sized, they will need to be manufactured 
  hence the first visit is purely to measure the window.</p>
  <p>If there is a pop-up i.e., for Gas No Access: <strong>HF</strong>, <strong>NA</strong> 
  or <strong>CI</strong> code, No Repair: <strong>NR</strong> code, or <strong>ALMO</strong>, 
  continue to order a repair (if applicable) then immediately contact the 
  <strong>RPIT Gas Team</strong>.</p>

<h3>Recharge</h3>
  <p>If the tenant admits breaking glass, an order should only be placed if the tenant agrees 
  to be recharged. (Unless gone through both panes and is a security issue) then raise a job 
  for board up only.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>If caused by tenant (<strong>no Police Crime Reference Number</strong>) advise tenant, 
  it will be a recharge and order job accordingly.</p>

  <h3>About the Right to Repair scheme</h3>

    <p>The right to repair scheme is designed to ensure that council tenants can get certain repairs 
    completed quickly and easily. It sets time limits for certain types of repairs, which councils must 
    stick to. If the contractors the council uses don't do the work in that time, a request can be made 
    to hire someone else. If the repairs still aren't done, compensation can be claimed by the 
    tenant/resident.</p>

  <h3>Repairs covered</h3>

    <p>It only covers certain repairs, known as 'qualifying repairs', which cost less than £250 to carry out. </p>

  <h3>Blocking Access</h3>

    <p>If a new tenant states that they cannot move into their new property due to scaffolding obstructing 
    access and blocking doors or windows; contact the Roofing team on internal number 0114 2735921 and also 
    inform the Vacants Team on </p>

    <a href="${window.location.protocol}//${
    window.location.hostname
  }/form/launch/refer_to_service?${
    KDF.getParams().customerid
      ? `customerid=${KDF.getParams().customerid}&`
      : ""
  }interactionid=${
    KDF.getParams().interactionid
  }&txt_emailservice=voids@sheffield.gov.uk">voids@sheffield.gov.uk</a>
    
  <p> It will then be arranged for the scaffolding to be moved to allow access. This will prevent any 
  discretionary payments to rent accounts via Vacants due to the tenant being unable to move into the property.</p>

  <h3>Scaffolding Process</h3>

    <p>This procedure only applies to Steel (or sometimes it says Fixed which is the same thing). Hi-Point 
    give SCC a date when they will be able to use it from which is the date put on screen as a "handover" 
    date, but they start erecting steels 2 days before due to health and safety procedures.</p>
    <p>To clarify, the process is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Day 1 Hi-Point erect a scaffold.</li>
        <li>Day 2 Hi-Point supervisors / inspectors inspect the scaffold to make sure they consider it is 
        safe to work on</li>
        <li>Day 3 SCC inspector inspects the scaffold to make sure it passes SCC safety procedures to work 
        on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With this procedure, they may be working on the scaffold on the 3rd day after the SCC inspector has 
    inspected, but sometimes the SCC inspector will fail the scaffold which means Hi-Point have to go back 
    and alter it and then the inspection procedure will start again which obviously will delay work.</p>
    <p>If the scaffold passes the inspection, they will work on it as soon as they can but have to fit this 
    in with day-to-day appointments and Urgent as the WAH and roofing teams do everything i.e., scaffolds, 
    appointments and Urgent. They will always get scaffold jobs done as soon as possible as we are charged 
    weekly for the scaffold.</p>

    <p>Remember that lots of jobs that use a scaffold do get delayed by adverse weather conditions i.e., 
    too wet, windy, or icy. There may also be other variables that can affect the work starting such as 
    operative absence, van breakdowns or emergency / urgent jobs taking priority, so please also bear these 
    possibilities in mind.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        Accommodation designed to be adaptable so that people can get the care and
        support they need at home.

      Enquiries that are specifically regarding the information in this page can be
      sent to Furnished using the links at the bottom of the page. If the enquiry is
      related to other matters, for instance estate management, tenancy management
      or Anti-social behaviour (ASB), then the appropriate form should be used to process that enquiry.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished Accommodation Cost</h3>
    <p>
      The cost depends on the package chosen and there are 3 tiers: Gold, Silver and
      Bronze. These carry £10, £15 and £20 per week charge that is payable over and
      above the net rent charge for the property.
    </p>
    <p>How it works</p>
    <p>There are three price bands to choose from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold - £23.94 per week (20 points)</li>
      <li>Silver - £17.96 per week (15 points)</li>
      <li>Bronze - £11.97 per week (10 points)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Legacy Charging Model (No longer used for New Furnished)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bedsit - £23.05</li>
      <li>1 Bed - £26.05</li>
      <li>2 Bed - £30.05</li>
      <li>3 Bed - £34.04</li>
      <li>4 Bed - £43.02</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each piece of furniture or floor covering will have a points value and the
      points will add up to package you want; Gold, Silver or Bronze. A Bronze
      package for example costs £10 a week and you can have 10 points worth of
      furniture (this could include a table and chairs, a settee, a fridge freezer
      and washing machine all at 2 points each and an armchair and crockery pack at
      1 point each). You can mix and match, depending on what furniture you already
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items of furniture and colour choices now available include washing machines,
      fridge freezers, vacuum cleaners, pots and pans and 3 colours of carpets and
      vinyl.
    </p>
    <h3>Customer wants an item of furniture replacing</h3>
    <p>
      The exchanging of furniture items is subject to a variety of factors
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The age of the goods as they still may be under warranty.</li>
      <li>
        If damaged – the reason for the damage - must be fair wear and tear or
        manufacturing fault / defect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most goods are assessed at the customer’s annual visit they receive and also
        all relevant electrical items are PAT tested at this time. The officer
        carrying out the visit will arrange any replacement goods if agreed and
        applicable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Customer no longer wants their furniture</h3>
    <p>
      There are instances where financial hardship may be caused by the service
      charge and / or the customer has sourced their own goods now. The process of
      removing the service charge is known as Deed of Variation and it takes
      approximately 10 weeks to complete as there are 2 notice periods with a 28 days
      cooling off periods legally built into them.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished and Local Assistance Scheme (LAS)</h3>
    <p>
      Furnished provide the goods and deliver them to customers who have applied for
      the grant / goods via Local Assistance Scheme. Furnished may provide
      installation at Council properties but do not perform installs at non-Council
      properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Furnished on Demand</h3>
    <p>
      The service is only available to new customers who are signing up for a new
      Council tenancy.
    </p>
    <p>Acceptance criteria:</p>

  </p>
  <p>
      Sheltered housing is rented accommodation that is specially designed for older
      people who are able to live independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It aims to provide comfortable accommodation with added security, in an
      environment where customers can come and go as they please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enquiries that are specifically regarding the information in this form can be
      sent to OPIL using the links at the bottom of the form. If the enquiry is
      related to other matters, for instance, Estate Management, Tenancy Management
      or Anti-social behaviour (ASB), then the appropriate form should be used to process that enquiry.
    </p>
    <h3>Where are the properties?</h3>
    <p>
      Schemes are scattered all over the city. A comprehensive list of properties
      can be found on the council website or in the Older Persons Independent Living
      Service leaflet.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What does the Sheltered Neighbourhood Officer do and New Tenancy Support
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Neighbourhood Officers will complete a support plan with the tenant when
      they move in. This replaces the standard 'New Tenancy Visit' that
      non-Sheltered tenants receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan is reviewed every six months or when there is a change in
      circumstances. We will agree with the customer the type and frequency of
      contact they require based on the customers needs. The Neighbourhood Officer
      will manage a Sheltered tenancy in the same way that a Neighbourhood Officer
      based in an area team would manage a standard tenancy, but will also include
      any support agreed in the support plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Neighbourhood Officers will help and support the customer to access any
      services they may need to help them live independently. The Neighbourhood
      Officers wardens will also contact relatives, call a doctor or an ambulance in
      an emergency.
    </p>
    <h3>What does OPIL provide</h3>
    <p>
      Convenient and comfortable accommodation with added security, in an
      environment where residents have their own front door and can come and go as
      they please. We can usually provide the following accommodation and
      facilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Self contained flats/Studio apartments/Bungalows</li>
      <li>Communal Facilities such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Caretaking service for the communal areas</li>
          <li>City Wide Care Alarm (24 hour emergency response)</li>
          <li>Gardens</li>
          <li>Guest room</li>
          <li>Kitchen</li>
          <li>Laundry</li>
          <li>Lounge for social activities</li>
          <li>Neighbourhood Officer Warden</li>
          <li>Security and Safety features</li>
        </ul>
      </li>    
    </ul>
    <h3>Who is eligible for OPIL accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone aged over 60 and is registered for rehousing. In the case of a couple,
      at least one person must fit the age requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before offering a property we will check to make sure it meets all your
      housing needs. You will also be invited to an accompanied viewing of the
      building without any commitment.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the costs of OPIL Accommodation</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of living in Sheltered Housing is very competitive when compared with
      other social housing providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You pay weekly rent and a service charge (where applicable) for the heating
      and hot water in your property and/or towards the heating in communal areas of
      the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an added support charge to cover the Neighbourhood Officer service
      and City Wide Alarm. If you are already in receipt of Housing Benefit you will
      not have to pay this charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are on a low income you can apply to have an assessment to see if you
      are entitled to any assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will receive help and advice on claiming Welfare and/or Housing Benefit at
      the start of your tenancy.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the benefits of OPIL Accommodation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Good quality housing</li>
      <li>Security</li>
      <li>Independence</li>
      <li>Your own front door</li>
      <li>Peace of mind, with help on hand in emergencies</li>

        A support plan - agreed with the Neighbourhood Officer - to meet individual
        needs
      </li>
      <li>Being part of the community</li>
    </ul>

  `<p><h3>Anti-social Behaviour</h3>
    <p>Anti-social behaviour is behaviour which is capable of causing nuisance, annoyance, harassment, alarm or distress to an individual or community. This could range from a relatively minor issue to serious criminal activity. We do not adopt a single definition of anti-social behaviour but instead consider each report based on the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Examples of behaviours we may consider to be anti-social are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Playing excessively loud music/television/video games</li>
      <li> Threatening or verbally abusing another person</li>
      <li> Damaging property</li>
      <li> Attacking another person</li>
      <li> Failing to control a pet / banned breed pet</li>
      <li> Misusing drugs or alcohol</li>
      <li> Incorrect disposal of rubbish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of behaviours we may not consider to be anti-social are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Reasonable household noise</li>
      <li> Carrying out DIY at reasonable times</li>
      <li> Babies crying</li>
      <li> A one-off party if noise was the only issue and it is unlikely to be repeated</li>
      <li> Children playing (including ball games)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reporting anti-social behaviour</h3>
    <p>If the ASB involves a Council tenant, use the form at the bottom of this page to raise a report to 
    the appropriate team. If it does not involve a Council tenant advise the customer to contact 101</p>
    
    <h3>Police responsibility</h3>
    <p>South Yorkshire Police are responsible for dealing with any behaviour or activity which results in a criminal offence being committed.</p>
    <p>Where the perpetrator is an SCC tenant the Tenancy Enforcement and Sustainment Team (TEST) will work closely with SYP to ensure that any appropriate enforcement action is taken by the council.</p>
    <p>We feel, it is not appropriate to list specific incidents that Police deal with as this may result in the issue just being reported to police and not being routed to appropriate SCC teams who may also need to look at enforcement action.</p>
    <h3>Council Responsibility</h3>
    <p>We are responsible for incidents involving:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> abandoned vehicles</li>
      <li> dead animals</li>
      <li> dog fouling</li>
      <li> fly posting</li>
      <li> dumped, fly-tipped waste</li>
      <li> inoffensive graffiti</li>
      <li> non-hate crime graffiti</li>
      <li> littering</li>
      <li> lost, stray or barking dogs</li>
      <li> noise nuisance or DIY related noise (We cannot log anonymous complaints about noise as we rely on evidence from the complainant, and observations at the complainant’s home, to evaluate whether the noise is a statutory nuisance).</li>
      <li> syringes or needles</li>
      <li> dumped, fly-tipped waste (nobody present)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that although all of the above are issues that the council will deal with, only noise nuisance and possibly barking dogs are generally dealt with by TEST (where it is a SCC tenant). A number of other teams are involved in managing these issues including Environmental services and Estates teams etc..</p>
    <h3>Hate Crime</h3>
    <h4>What is hate crime?</h4>
    <p>Hate Crime is any criminal offence committed against a person or property that is motivated by an offender’s hatred of someone because of their Disability, Race, Religion or Beliefs, Sexual Orientation or Transgender.</p>
    <p>Crimes committed against someone because of their disability, transgender-identity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation are hate crimes and should be reported to the police.</p>
    <p>Hate crimes can include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> threatening behaviour</li>
      <li> assault</li>
      <li> robbery</li>
      <li> damage to property</li>
      <li> inciting others to commit hate crimes</li>
      <li> harassment</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You must pay your rent.</li>
          <li>You must look after and carry out any day-to-day maintenance to the property.</li>

          You must not keep any animal which we consider to be dangerous or which may cause a nuisance. You must not keep a dog or a cat in a flat or maisonette which has shared parts or a shared entrance. If you live in a small block of flats or maisonettes, we will give you written permission to keep a dog or cat if all the tenants who use the same shared parts of the building have agreed to you keeping the dog or cat. 
          If we give our permission, we may withdraw it if your pet causes nuisance or upset to any of your neighbours. If we gave you written permission before 3rd April 1995 to keep a dog or cat in a block of flats containing more than 12 homes, you can continue to keep that dog or cat. 
          You must not keep any pigeons or doves in or on any part of the property unless before 3rd April 1995 we gave you written permission to do so. Parrots, budgies, etc., are allowed as long as they are not causing a nuisance.

            <li>You have not paid the rent or not kept to these conditions.</li>
            <li>You or anybody living with you or visiting you has caused a nuisance or annoyance to other people, has been convicted for using the premises for illegal or immoral purposes, or convicted of a serious offence in or near the premises.</li>
            <li>If you have been living with someone as their partner and your partner has left because of violence or threats of violence from you, either to them or a member of the family, and it is unlikely they will return.</li>
            <li>You have damaged the property or common parts.</li>
            <li>You or anybody living with you has damaged any furniture provided by the Council.</li>
            <li>You got the tenancy because you or somebody else on your behalf made false statements.</li>
            <li>You refuse to leave a property which we let to you temporarily while work was being carried out at your own property.</li>
            <li>You will usually have a chance to put things right before the Council Housing Service evicts you. The Council Housing Service will usually seek to evict you if you, your household or guests harass people (unless other legal action is more appropriate).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service can evict you for the following reasons, if the court is satisfied that there is suitable alternative accommodation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If your home is overcrowded as defined in the Housing Act 1985.</li>
            <li>If your home is to be altered or demolished and this cannot be done while you’re still living there.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service will consult you if the Council Housing Service wants to evict you because of these reasons. The Council Housing Service will also offer you alternative accommodation which meets your reasonable needs.</p>
        <p>The Council Housing Service can evict you for the following reasons if the court is satisfied that it is reasonable and you could get suitable alternative accommodation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The home was designed or adapted for a disabled person and there is no longer a disabled person living in the home but the home is required for a disabled person.</li>
            <li>The home is one to which special services are provided and there is no longer anyone living in the home who needs the special services and the home is required for someone who does.</li>
            <li>The home is much larger than you reasonably need and you have taken over the tenancy from another member of your family. (This reason is rarely used).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Council Housing Service will consult you if the Council Housing Service wants to evict you because of these reasons. The Council Housing Service will also offer you alternative accommodation which meets your reasonable needs. If the Council Housing Service has to go to court you can challenge the reasons given by the Council Housing Service to evict you and/or the suitability of the alternative accommodation offered by the Council Housing Service. You should get legal advice before you do this. These reasons for ending tenancies are part of the Housing Act 1985.</p>

        <p>If you abandon your property, the Council Housing Service will treat it as a surrender of your tenancy, and the Council Housing Service may re-enter the property and relet it. You will be responsible for the rent until the Council Housing Service accepts the surrender. If you do not use the property as your only or principal home, the Council Housing Service may serve you with a Notice to Quit.</p>

        <p>IMFIT (Rents) can provide a financial reference for you. Your Neighbourhood Support Team can provide a Tenancy Reference.</p>
        <p>Both of these may be subject to charges before the reference is returned.</p>
        <p>If this is for a mortgage company or a private landlord, the company needs to put this request in writing. There is a charge for this of £60, which must be paid to IMFIT before the reference is returned. The fee can be paid by debit/credit card or by BACS. If they want to pay this, transfer the call to IMFIT - this is NOT paid to the rent account.</p>

        <strong>Reference requests should be sent to:</strong><br>
        <address>
          Sheffield Council Housing Service<br>
          PO Box 5967<br>
          Sheffield<br>
          S2 9GH</p>
        </address>
        <p>For Social Landlords (Housing Associations), these also need to be put in writing, but there is no charge. Social Landlords can also email details of their request to <a href="mailto:customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk">customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk</a> if they prefer to send an email.</p>
