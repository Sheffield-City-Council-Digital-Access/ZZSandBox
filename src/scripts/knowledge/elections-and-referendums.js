      Parish Councils are separate local authorities to the City Council, with their
      own elected members. They are wholly contained within the City Council
      boundary. A parish councillor can stand for election to the City Council and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parish elections are held once every four years and usually at the same time
      as an election to the City Council. There are three parish councils in
      Sheffield, which are split into smaller parish wards:
      <ul>
        <li>Bradfield Parish Council</li>
        <li>Ecclesfield Parish Council</li>
        <li>Stocksbridge Town Council</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can only vote at a Parish election if you live within the parish. 
      More details around the Parish Elections can be found here:

      Only British citizens may register as Overseas Voters (other Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Irish Republic may not) – allowing them to vote at UK Parliamentary and European Parliamentary elections.<br/>
      <br/>
      Registration is allowed for 15 years from the date an elector was last registered as a UK resident. If you were too young to register when you left the UK, your parent or guardian must have been registered.<br/>
      <br/>
      As an overseas voter, you are eligible to vote in elections for the UK Parliament and the European Parliament. You cannot vote in UK local or mayoral elections, or elections to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the London Assembly.<br/>
      <br/>
      If you live in a country which is a member of the European Union, you can vote in that country's own local and European parliamentary elections. But, you cannot vote in European elections in more than one country.

      The electoral register is compiled for election purposes and is not intended
      to be used as a tool for searching for lost relatives. Registers are split
      into the 6 parliamentary constituencies, then into the wards wihtin those
      constituencies. Each ward is broken down into the polling district each
      polling station serves and then into each street within that district.
      Properties are then sorted by address order - not by name.
