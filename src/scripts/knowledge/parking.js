      permit holders only, disabled and loading bays are kept clear of parked
      vehicles in certain circumstances such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Maintenance of adjacent property where highway access is required for
        deliveries, essential vehicles, skips etc.

      <li>Security reasons</li>
      <li>Filming - contact us about filming in the city</li>
      <li>Any other reason accepted by ourselves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Parking Services will not suspend bays to provide parking for vehicles unless
      they are essential for works in the suspended area (such as an asbestos
      removal vehicle).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other works or private vehicles should be parked legally elsewhere (for
      example in nearby pay and display parking).
    </p>
    <h3>Submitting your application</h3>
    <p>
      Applications for parking bay suspensions should be made at least 14 days
      before the suspension start date.
    </p>
    <h3>Charges and payment</h3>
    <p>
      If the application is accepted, Parking Services will contact the customer for
      payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full payment must be made at least 9 days before the suspension start date.
      You can pay by credit card, debit card, or BACS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daily charge per 5m section of bay is £17.90 for City Centre controlled
      parking zone, with a non-refundable administration fee of £29.85. The daily

    <p>
      Parking Services will consider dispensations to allow vehicles which are being
      used as a workshop vehicle (e.g. vehicle where there is equipment which needs
      to be used directly from the vehicle as part of the work being carried out at
      an adjacent property) to park on yellow lines, or in bays for longer than
      restrictions allow.
    </p>
    <h3>Dispensations are unlikely to be granted if:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A loading ban applies</li>
      <li>The vehicle is likely to cause an obstruction to traffic flow</li>
      <li>The vehicle may be hazardous to other road users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If dispensation is granted, we will issue a signed written notice which must
      be clearly displayed on the parked vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dispensations are vehicle and location specific, if the dispensation notice
      has been altered in any way it will be deemed invalid.
    </p>
    <h3>Submitting your application</h3>
    <p>
      Applications for dispensations should be made at least 7 days before the
      dispensation start date.
    </p>
    <h3>Charges and payment</h3>
    <p>
      If the application is accepted, Parking Services will contact the customer for
      payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full payment is required before dispensation can be granted. There is a charge
      of £17.90 per vehicle per day for a dispensation as well as a £29.85 non-refundable
      administration fee.

	<p>
	    A green parking permit allows Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) that meet the following criteria to park in the city centre for free. 
	    Anyone with an eligible vehicle can apply for it.
	</p>
	
	<p>The vehicle must be:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>electric or hybrid fuel type</li>
	    <li>emit less then 75g of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre travelled, with a capability of travelling a minimum range of 10 miles with zero CO2 emissions</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	    You can use the DVLA checker to see if your vehicle meets these standards. 
	    It may show 0g on the CO2 emissions for some diesel vehicles as this data is not on their records. 
	    Such vehicles are not ULEVs and do not qualify for a green parking permit.

parking zones. 
The permit is a paper disc with a timer which will allow staff to park in any permit zone outside the city centre for a limited time.</p>

<h4>If you work for the NHS</h4>

<p>If you are an NHS practitioner or carer you should apply for a separate parking permit.</p>

<h4>If you work for the Council</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mental health social workers visiting a patient who may need to be detained
    under the Mental Health Act
  </li>
  <li>Primary care outreach nurses</li>

<p>Permits do not entitle you to park at directly at your address, but they allow you to park in any designated on street parking space within the zone
your permit is for.</p>

<p>The permit is issued virtually so you don’t need to display it in your window. 
Once your licence plate is registered as holding a permit you can use on street parking.</p>

<p>Whether or not you can apply will depend on your home address, which will need to be within a parking zone to be eligible for a permit.</p>

If you are moving into a new property and the Resident parking permit application shows the price being offered is not correct, this is likely to be because the previous tenants/owners have permits that are still valid.
</p>
<p>
Email your signed tenancy agreement or proof of property purchase to <a href="mailto:customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk">customerservices@sheffield.gov.uk</a>. Add the subject “Please check the address and cancel existing permits".
</p>
<p>
We can then identify the new residents. This should allow the cancellation of the existing permits. Once this is done, and an email confirming this has been received, the correct pricing should then be in place for applications to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
If you have moved or are moving from an address where you hold a parking permit, email us with the subject “Please cancel my permit” and specify the date that this can be completed. We'll act on your instructions to allow the new tenants to buy their permits at the correct price.

<p>A permit does not guarantee parking directly at your address, but it will allow your visitors to park in on street parking bays within your permit zone. You can also give permits to contractors who are carrying out work on your home for up to two weeks. Likewise, you could provide a visitors permit to your landlord if they need to visit your property to do work. 
Contractors needing more time to work at a property will need to apply for trade permits. Landlords can apply for trade permits too.</p>

<p>You can only apply for visitor permits for the parking zone you live in.</p>

<h4>Cost</h4>

<p>One book of 25 permits costs £19.35.</p>

<h4>Case is at Debt Registration – What Are the Customer’s Options?</h4>

<p>If the case is currently at debt registration, this means that we are unable to accept representations from the customer.</p>

<p>Their options moving forward are to either pay the PCN or file a Witness Statement with the Traffic Enforcement Centre.</p>

<p>The reasons for filing a Witness Statement are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grounds 1: Did not get a ‘notice to owner’ telling you how to make a formal challenge</li>
  <li>Grounds 2: Made a formal challenge on time but did not get a ‘notice of rejection’</li>
  <li>Grounds 3: Appealed to an independent tribunal on time but did not get a response</li>
  <li>Grounds 4: Have proof you’ve paid the penalty charge, such as a credit card statement</li>
</ul>

<p>To file a Witness Statement, they will need to complete Form TE9.<br>
Form TE9 can be found at: 
<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62e14db38fa8f5649f912647/TE9.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62e14db38fa8f5649f912647/TE9.pdf</a></p>

<h4>Case is at Warrant – What Are the Customer’s Options?</h4>

<p>If the case is currently at warrant/enforcement agents, this means that we are unable to accept representations from the customer.</p>

<p>Their options moving forward are to either pay the PCN with the enforcement agents or file a Late Witness Statement with the Traffic Enforcement Centre.</p>

<p>The reasons for filing a Late Witness Statement are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grounds 1: Did not get a ‘notice to owner’ telling you how to make a formal challenge</li>
  <li>Grounds 2: Made a formal challenge on time but did not get a ‘notice of rejection’</li>
  <li>Grounds 3: Appealed to an independent tribunal on time but did not get a response</li>
  <li>Grounds 4: Have proof you’ve paid the penalty charge, such as a credit card statement</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, they will need to complete Forms TE7 and TE9.<br>

        <p>If you are struggling to pay, debt advisors may be able to offer you support with Breathing Space through the 
        Debt Respite Scheme, which offers two types of breathing space:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard Breathing Space</li>
          <li>Mental Health Crisis Breathing Space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Debt advisors can also assist with applying for a Debt Relief Order (DRO) to help manage 
        debts you cannot pay. More information about DROs is available here:</p>
