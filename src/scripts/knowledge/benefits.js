      If you need help paying rent or housing arrears, you must apply for Universal Credit, Housing Benefit, a Discretionary Housing Payment or a Homelessness Prevention Grant.
      If you can prove you are ineligible for these benefits, in extreme circumstances we may be able to help with rent arrears or deposits for new tenancies.

      If you have provided us with an email address, written confirmation of the decision will be sent to you by email. 
      If you do not have an email address, the decision notice will be sent to your home address by second class post.
      If you have no recourse to public funds, you may in some circumstances be eligible for assistance. 
      Your immigration status will not be affected by any award made under the Household Support Fund.

    <h3>Central heating</h3>
    <div class="accordion-icon"></div>
  </summary>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>
      Knowing how your central heating system works will help you keep warm and save money.
    </p>
    <h3>Room thermostat</h3>
    <p>
      Usually on the living room or hall wall, it senses when the house is warm enough and 
      turns the boiler off automatically. It should be set at between 18 to 21 degrees C 
      (65 to 70 degrees F), slightly higher if you are an older person or have young children.
    </p>
    <h3>Thermostatic radiator valve</h3>
    <p>
      These are fitted to your radiators and allow you to set different temperatures in different 
      rooms. The lower the number or comfort level on the valve, the less heat the radiator 
      will give off.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use the system</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>try to maintain a comfortable, even temperature throughout your home</li>
        <li>don’t keep heating or hot water on too long or at times when you don’t need it</li>
        <li>set the controller to bring the heating/hot water on about half an hour before you get up and to go off half an hour before you go to bed</li>
        <li>remember to keep your home well ventilated to reduce condensation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Gas fires</h3>
    <p>
      If you have one, make sure it is kept free of dust and isn’t covered up. 
      If there is a ventilator in the window, don’t block it up otherwise harmful fumes could build up. 
      We recommend you don’t use the fire at the same time as the central heating.
    </p>
    <h3>Fuel costs</h3>
    <p>
    If fear of high bills is stopping you heating your home, here are some tips to help:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>compare fuel costs between different suppliers to get a better deal. Visit <a href="https://www.energyhelpline.com/" target="_blank">https://www.energyhelpline.com/</a> or call <a href="tel:0800 0740745">0800 0740745</a> </li>

  </summary>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>
      The government is offering two schemes which provide funding to people who do not 
      have a direct contract with an energy supplier and are therefore not eligible for 
      the current Energy Bill Support Scheme. 
    </p>
    <h3>Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding</h3>
    <p>
      The Energy Bills Support Scheme Alternative Funding provides eligible residences with 
      a £400 discount on their energy bills. This includes, for example, care home residents 
      or those living in properties with energy costs paid to a commercial landlord.
    </p>
    <h3>Alternative Fuel Payments Scheme</h3>
    <p>
      The Alternative Fuel Payments Scheme offers a discount of £200 to those using alternative 
      fuels such as biomass or heating oil.
    </p>
    <h3>How to apply</h3>
    <p>
      If you are eligible for one of these schemes, you will need to apply through the GOV.UK website. 
      Once you have made an application and it's been approved, your payment details will be shared 
      with the Council in order to process your payment. A privacy notice regarding sharing personal 
      information is available for you to read on our privacy notice page which can be found here:

    <h3>Supporting your employees</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most tangible and direct ways any organisation can help alleviate the 
      cost-of-living crisis is to provide support to their own employees. 
      Below are some ideas that you may wish to consider as part of this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>paying the living wage</li>
        <li>set up a cost-of-living task force to understand the needs of your employees</li>
        <li>consider a one-off cost of living payment</li>
        <li>signpost employees to the help available across the city</li>
        <li>establish an emergency loan service for staff</li>
        <li>champion equality and assess who is being impacted</li>
        <li>run support and wellbeing sessions</li>
        <li>encourage employees to receive help by breaking down perceptions of shame and stigma</li>
        <li>provide free food or a breakfast</li>
        <li>pay untaken leave</li>

    <h3>Discretionary Housing Payment and Council Tax Hardship Scheme</h3>
    <div class="accordion-icon"></div>
  </summary>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>
      The Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) scheme can help you if you get Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, 
      but you still need help to pay your rent. If you get Council Tax Support (CTS) you can also get help to pay 
      your Council Tax under the Council Tax Hardship Scheme (CTHS).
    </p>
      <section class="alert-panel--ineligible" role="alert" aria-label="Alert panel">
        <p>
          Changes to our IT systems may cause delays in processing changes to housing benefit claims, discretionary housing payments, 
          requests for Council Tax support and council tax hardship scheme awards.
          We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3>What DHP can't help with</h3>
    <p>
      There are some charges that DHP can’t cover including:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>service charges like heating or hot water</li>
        <li>charges for water rates</li>
        <li>charges for tenants levy</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <h3>How much we can award and how long the award lasts</h3>
    <p>
      The amount of DHP we can award and how long the award lasts depends on your own circumstances. You must be able to show that you need extra help to meet your housing costs.
      The amount of CTHS we can award depends upon your circumstances, and in most cases, the award you receive will be made for the current financial year.
      DHP and CTHS come from a fixed pot of money, so we try to give the extra help to people who need it most. Once we’ve spent the money in the pot, no further awards can be made.
    </p>
      <h3>How we pay</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re a Council tenant, we’ll pay your DHP directly to your rent account. If you’re a private tenant, we’ll pay your DHP in the same way as your Housing Benefit.
      If you’re in receipt of Universal Credit, we will make the payment directly to you, or your landlord.
      If you’re awarded CTHS, we’ll reduce your Council Tax and send you a new bill for a lower amount.
    </p>
      <h3>The application process</h3>
    <p>
      You need to provide as much information as you can about how much you spend each week on items like food, bills, clothes, your children and travel.
      You don’t have to provide details of your income as we get this from your Housing Benefit claim. When we receive your application form and have checked your 
      supporting information we’ll write to you with a decision.
    </p>
      <h3>If you need to appeal</h3>
    <p>
      If you don’t agree with our decision you can contact the Discretionary Payment Team and ask us to look at your application again.
      You must appeal within one month of the date of your decision letter. You should provide any information you feel may help your 
      application and we’ll review our decision and write to you with the outcome.

      Universal Credit is a single benefit that has been introduced to replace the current six-benefit system. 
      It is designed to assist working-age individuals with low incomes, or those who are unemployed. 
      This benefit aims to provide support for people to prepare for work, find employment, or increase their earnings.
    </p>
    <section class="info-panel" role="region" aria-label="Information panel">
      <p>
        If you have previously been receiving any of the following six benefits, you will stop receiving these and be moved over to Universal Credit:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Housing Benefit</li>
        <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</li>
        <li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)</li>
        <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
        <li>Working Tax Credit</li>

      <h3>How much you could receive</h3>
      <p>
      The amount you receive will depend on:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>your (or your partner's) income and savings</li>
          <li>your (or your partner's) age(s)</li>
          <li>circumstances (such as children, a couple or single)</li>
          <li>if you or your partner are incapable of work or a carer</li>
          <li>if you have housing costs, like rent</li>
          <li>your entitlement to a transitional amount</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>How Universal Credit is paid</h3>
      <p>
        Universal Credit is paid monthly in arrears. If you think that you will struggle 
        while you are waiting for your first payment of Universal Credit, you can ask the DWP for a short-term advance.
        You may be able to have your Universal Credit paid more frequently than monthly, or have it paid direct to your landlord.
      </p>
      <h3>How to apply for Universal Credit</h3>
      <p>
        You can apply for Universal Credit on the government website.
        In order to claim Universal Credit you will need to sign a claimant commitment when you make your first claiming. 
        This is a signed record of what you agree to do whilst in receipt of Universal Credit.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <section class="alert-panel--ineligible" role="alert" aria-label="Alert panel">
    <p>
        Changes to our IT systems may cause delays in processing changes to housing benefit claims, 
        discretionary housing payments, requests for Council Tax support and council tax hardship scheme awards.
        We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.
    </p>
    </section>
    <p>
    If you’re on a low income you can apply for Housing Benefit to help you pay for part or all of your rent.
    You can apply for Housing Benefit whether you’re unemployed or working, and whether you rent from the private sector, 
    a Housing Association or our Council housing.
    </p>
    <section class="alert-panel--ineligible" role="alert" aria-label="Alert panel">
    <h3>Universal Credit</h3>
    <p>
        From November 2018 if you need to start a new Housing Benefit claim you may have to claim Universal Credit.
    </p>
    </section>
    <h3>How much you could receive</h3>
    <p>
        There’s no set amount of Housing Benefit. What you receive will be affected by:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
          <li>if you are a private tenant. What you get will depend on whether you are restricted by the Local Housing Allowance</li>
          <li>if you rent from us. Following the under-occupancy rule (or bedroom tax), you will receive less support if you have empty bedrooms in your house or flat</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <section class="alert-panel--ineligible" role="alert" aria-label="Alert panel">
    <h3>Urgent payment</h3>
    <p>
        If your claim hasn’t been processed yet and you need payment urgently because you’re facing eviction you must contact us as soon as possible.
        You will need to send or bring in a copy of any information you’ve received about eviction proceedings. Once we have the evidence we need, 
        we’ll arrange to pay your Housing Benefit as soon as we can.
    </p>
    </section>
    <h3>Receiving payment</h3>
    <p>
      You should claim as soon as you can. We can usually pay Housing Benefit from the Monday after the day we receive your claim form. 
      We can only backdate your benefit for up to one month from when you make your claim.
      If you live in our Council housing, we’ll pay Housing Benefit directly into your rent account. You won’t receive the money.
      If you’re a private tenant, we’ll usually pay Housing Benefit into your bank or building society account, 
      although we may decide that it’s in your best interests to pay your Housing Benefit directly to your landlord.
    </p>
    <h3>Applying for Housing Benefit if you’re claiming other benefits</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re claiming Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance, contact Jobcentre Plus to claim Housing Benefit too. 
      Jobcentre Plus will send us details of your claim for Housing Benefit.If you’re claiming Universal Credit, you can get help paying for housing with your 
      Universal Credit payment instead of getting Housing Benefit.
      If you’re claiming Pension Credit, contact the Pension Service to claim Housing Benefit with your claim for Pension Credit. 
      The Pension Service will send us details of your claim for Housing Benefit.
    </p>
    <h3>Apply for Housing Benefit if you’re not claiming other benefits</h3>
    <p>
      If you’re not claiming other benefits, you can apply online for Housing Benefit.
      Once you've applied, we’ll let you know what information we need from you to support your claim. 
      This may include information like your National Insurance Number, your birth certificate or driving licence, 
      and evidence that you pay the rent, like your rent book or tenancy agreement.
      You should provide this information as soon as you can so we can deal with your claim as quickly as possible. 
      When you provide evidence please bare in mind the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
          <li>we can only accept original documents as proof. We can’t accept photocopies</li>
          <li>you can bring the documents we need to First Point or any Area Housing Office</li>
          <li>if you supply the proofs in person we’ll photocopy them and give you the originals back. We’ll also give you a receipt. You should ask to see the photocopies and make sure that you’re satisfied that the copies are clear and legible</li>
          <li>if we need more evidence, we’ll write to you as soon as possible to let you know</li>
      </ul>

      if you’re on a low income or you claim benefits. You can apply if you own your home, rent, are unemployed or working.
      What you receive will depend on:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>your circumstances (for example income, number of children, benefits, residency status)</li>
        <li>your household income - this includes savings, pensions and your partner’s income</li>
        <li>if your children live with you</li>
        <li>if other adults live with you</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <h4>Council Tax discounts and exemptions</h4>
    <p>
      Certain people are eligible for discounts or exemptions from Council Tax, including students, people who are disabled and people who live alone.
    </p>
      <h4>Help with rent and Council Tax</h4>
    <p>
      The Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) scheme can help you if you get Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, but you still need help to pay your rent. 
      If you get Council Tax Support (CTS) you can also get help to pay your Council Tax under the Council Tax Hardship Scheme (CTHS).
    </p>
      <h4>Help with your water bill</h4>
    <p>
      If you are on benefits, on a low income, have debt connected to your water bill, or have a medical condition that means you need to use more water, 
      you may be eligible for help paying your water bill. Yorkshire Water runs a number of schemes that can reduce the amount you pay for water each month.
    </p>
      <h3>Check if you could get additional income</h3>
    <p>
      Billions of pounds of benefits go unclaimed each year and many people don’t know what they are entitled to, 
      but a simple check can assist you to make a claim. Use a benefits calculator to find out what you could receive.
    </p>
      <h3>Help with telephone and broadband costs</h3>
    <p>
      Many telephone and broadband companies have social tariffs for people claiming Universal Credit, Pension Credit and some other benefits.
    </p>
      <h3>Access crisis grants if you're in hardship</h3>
    <p>
      If you are in hardship and cannot afford food, energy and other essentials, you may be eligible for a payment under the Household Support Fund.
      If you are in crisis following an emergency or disaster, or need help to remain in your home, you may be eligible for a payment under the Local Assistance Scheme.

          will be reflected in the Business Rates you pay from 1 April 2023. The government 
          has announced a package of rates relief for businesses as part of the Autumn Statement 2022, 
          to help businesses adjust to the new rates. We are awaiting full details of this scheme 
          from Government and will update the information here as soon as with have these details.

                  Your organisation must be charitable, religious or concerned with education, social welfare, science, literature or the fine arts, 
                  or the property must be used by a non-profit-making organisation wholly or mainly for the purpose of recreation.

                  We have discretion to award rate relief where a business is experiencing hardship. 
                  Hardship will only be awarded if it is believed to be in the

                Any other businesses in the qualifying rural areas, which have a rateable value of up to £16,500 can apply for relief. However, we have the sole discretion whether to award the relief or not.

              <h4>Reductions on main properties</h4>
              <p>
                You may be entitled to a reduction in the business rates bill on your main property 
                if you occupy more than one non-domestic property in England if:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the total rateable value of your main property plus all the other properties you occupy is less than £20,000 and</li>
                <li>each of your other properties has a Rateable Value (RV) of less than £2,900</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In calculating relief, your main property will be classed as the property with the higher RV.
              </p>
              <h4>Small business rate relief - extension regulations</h4>
              <p>
                Since 1 April 2014, those businesses that have taken on an additional property which would normally have meant the loss of small business rate relief are allowed 
                to keep that relief on the first occupied property for a period of 12 months. You will still be able to receive the relief on your existing qualifying 
                property even if the total RV of your properties is higher than the £20,000 limit which normally applies.
              </p>
              <h4>Change in your circumstances</h4>
              <p>
                Small business rate relief will continue until there is a relevant change in your circumstances. Relevant changes are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>an increase in the rateable value of a property you occupy which is not in our billing area – these changes will have to be notified in writing</li>
                <li>you take up occupation of any property which is not mentioned in your application for relief – these changes will have to be notified through a fresh application</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you believe your business may qualify for relief please complete the 'Small Business Rates Relief application form'.

              <p>
                Transitional arrangements soften the impact of revaluation by phasing in the changes to the rates bill over a period of time. 
                Different transitional arrangements will apply depending on whether your business premises are classed as small or large. 
                Transition can also affect your bill if you obtain a reduction in your Rateable Value (RV) from a date other than 1 April 2017. 
                The Valuation Officer may certify that it should have taken effect from the beginning of the Rating List, but that the list cannot be updated due to backdating restrictions. 
                If your bill receives a Transitional Adjustment, the amount you pay is calculated by increasing the previous year's net rate (that is, the amount you actually paid) by up 
                to the maximum amount permitted by the government for each year.
              </p>
              <h4>Level of transitional relief</h4>
              <p>
                If a property has a RV of more than £100,000 and is facing an increase in its bill, it is classed as a <strong>higher tier loser.</strong> 
                If a property has a RV of between £20,001 and £100,000 and is facing an increase in its bill, it is classed as a <strong>middle tier loser. </strong>
                If a property has a RV of up to £20,000 and is facing an increase in its bill, it is classed as a <strong>lower tier loser.</strong>
              </p>
              <h4>Percentage of the bill that increases or decreases</h4>
              <p>
                Once we have found out what level of relief should apply, we then take the annual figure for 2022/23 and increase or decrease it by the appropriate percentage 
                that is determined by the Government.
              </p>
              <h4>Apply an inflation adjustment</h4>
              <p>
                Once the percentage increase is applied to last years charge, we have to add an adjustment for inflation. This is the level of 
                inflation as at the previous September.
              </p>
              <h4>Rateable Value changes</h4>
              <p>
                If your RV is changed, we will have to recalculate your entitlement to transitional relief. It is quite possible that a reduction in 
                your RV may not result in an immediate reduction in your bill.
              </p>
              <h4>Check your relief</h4>
              <p>
                If you would like us to check that your calculation is correct, please contact us. There is no right of appeal against transitional relief. 
                It is part of business rates legislation and we have no powers to change or waver it.

              <p>
                We may award Living Wage Relief for a non-domestic property where:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>the ratepayer of that property is an employer who is accredited with the Living Wage Foundation</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                Where an organisation is liable for more than one property and those properties have a combined rateable value of over £50,000 no relief will be awarded for any of those properties. 
                This relief is available in respect of the financial year 2016/17, and the level of relief will be up to £5,000. We may only make an award where we are satisfied that the organisation is accredited with the Living Wage Foundation. 
                We must also be satisfied that the organisation's application for accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation was made on or after 1 April 2016, and had not paid its employees a wage above the Living Wage Foundation rate prior to 1 April 2016. 
                Accreditation must be in respect of employees working at the property in Sheffield.
                The Living Wage Foundation monitors its accredited organisations, and should any business break the agreement within 2 years of signing it any relief awarded may be reclaimed.

                <li>occupied (empty premises do not qualify)</li>

              <h4>Apply</h4>
              <p>
                To apply for the reduction, complete the 'Partly Empty Properties Relief application form', and provide a plan of your property, 
                clearly indicating which proportion of your premises is occupied and which is unoccupied. Once we have received your information, 
                we will visit your premises to inspect them and verify your claim.
              </p>
              <h4>Our decision</h4>
              <p>
                If we think you should qualify for the relief, we will ask the Valuation Office to issue a certificate to confirm the rateable value of the empty part. 
                Once we receive this, we will apply the appropriate relief or exemption to the empty part and send you a revised bill. 
                The period of relief will normally be for a maximum of 3 months, or 6  months in the case of industrial premises. 
                If you have received any notices from us regarding non-payment, please see payment problems. 
                Any properties where we have granted the relief will be subject to periodic visits from our property inspector. 
                If any parts of the area you have previously claimed to be empty are found to be occupied, your relief may be cancelled.

      community. A Sheffield Independence Grant can help:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You, a member of your family, someone you look after or someone you will be
          looking after, to return to the community from care

          You, a member of your family, someone you look after or someone you will be
          looking after, to return to the community from prison

        <li>
          You, a member of your family, someone you look after or someone you will be
          looking after, to stay in the community instead of going into care
        </li>
        <li>Ease exceptional pressure on individuals and families *</li>
        <li>
          You or your partner look after someone on leave from prison or a young
          offender’s institution on a temporary licence

      It can also be used to help with certain travel expenses in the UK. The
      journey could be:
      <ul>
        <li>To visit a close friend or family member who is ill</li>
        <li>To attend a relative’s funeral</li>
        <li>
