    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
      Your child is eligible for a Free School Meal if you receive any of the
      following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance</li>
      <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Support under Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999</li>
      <li>The Guarantee element of State Pension Credit</li>
      <li>
        Child Tax Credit, provided they are not entitled to Working Tax Credit and
        have an annual income of £16,190 or less
      </li>
      <li>
        Working Tax Credit 'run-on' - the payment someone may receive for a further
        four weeks after they stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit
      </li>
      <li>
        Universal Credit - In England, if you applied on or after 1 April 2018 your
        household income must be less than £7,400 a year (after tax and not
        including any benefits you get).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your child/ren is/are currently eligible for free school meals, they’ll
      remain eligible until they finish the phase of schooling (primary or
      secondary) they’re in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your child/ren is/are currently attending an Oasis school, they need to apply for Free School Meals with that school directly.
    </p>
    <h3>Change in circumstance</h3>
    <p>
      If your circumstances change, such as if you no longer receive benefits, have
      moved house, or the school attended has changed, this may affect your right to
      claim, and you should reapply for Free School Meals, unless the School
      attending is out of Sheffield you will need to apply to that local authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a previous application for free school meals was not successful and a
      change in your circumstances means that you think you may now be eligible
      please contact the Free School Meals Team. You will need to complete another
      application form. If your child currently receives a free school meal and you
      start work, start to receive Working Tax Credit, or stop receiving one of the
      qualifying benefits you must notify us as soon as possible.
    </p>

          <div class="details-accordion-content">
            <p>
              Applying for free school meals is very important because the amount of
              money that your child’s school receives from central government
              depends on the number of children registered as entitled to free
              school meals. The government has also stated that it is keen for
              universities to actively recruit pupils that have previously received
              free school meals so it is important that those eligible for free
              school meals do register for them. Most importantly, receiving up free
              school meals will save you around £360 per year per child and enable
              your child to have a balanced and nutritious lunch.

              Although Primary School Children within the year groups: Reception,
              Year 1 and Year 2 automatically receive Free School Meals, we
              recommend people still apply for Free School Meals as this provides
              Funding to the Schools via Pupil Premium.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children within the Year groups 3 - 6 can only receive a free school
              meal if their parents/carers are eligible and if a Free School Meals
              Application Form has been completed. You must therefore complete a
              Free School Meals Application Form so that your eligibility can be
              checked by the Free School Meals Team. If you are eligible, your child
              will start receiving their free school meal.

              Over 16s can still receive free school meals if they are staying in

              Application Form. The process is the same as the process for secondary
              school applications. All year 11 pupils applying for the 16-19 bursary

              need to complete a free school meals application form in order to

              support students aged 16 to 19 to stay in education and is the

  `
    <p>
      From April 2024, eligible working parents of 2-year-olds can access 15 hours
      childcare support. By September 2025, eligible working families with children
      aged between 9 months and 5 years old will be entitled to 30 hours of
      childcare support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The changes are being introduced gradually to make sure that providers can
      meet the needs of more families. This means that:
    </p>
    <p>
      From September 2025, eligible working parents of children from 9 months to
      school age will be entitled to 30 hours of childcare a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the existing offer, depending on your provider, these hours can be used
      over 38 weeks of the year, or up to 52 weeks if you use fewer than your total
      hours per week.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eligible children are entitled to at least 570 hours of funded childcare
      each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEL helps children learn through play activities. Some benefits that parents
      have seen:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>children making friends their own age</li>
      <li>children behaving better with grown-ups</li>
      <li>children improving their speech and language</li>
      <li>children settle down and concentrate for longer</li>
      <li>
        children are more willing to try new foods which improves their nutrition
      </li>
      <li>
        younger children improving their sleeping patterns and toilet training
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The funded hours also help parents and carers access employment and training,
      spend time with their younger children or just find time to get things done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours must be taken over a minimum of 38 weeks (15 hours a week, or 30 if
      entitled to additional hours) but can be taken over more weeks: for example,
      your child could take 12 hours a week for 47½ weeks. Talk to your childcare
      provider about what options are available. For Funded Early Learning enquiries
      and more information on the Family Hubs for Families, please contact the
      Family Hubs - <a href="tel:0114 2735665">0114 2735665</a>

    <p>
      For information about the new 2-year-old extended working entitlement (15
      hours offer starts April 2024, from 9 months old from September 2024) please

      families details of childcare support they might be eligible for and a link to

      22,500 letters sent to parents/carers with a unique eCode to exchange for a
      £15 food voucher to cover them over the half term break (see copy of the
      letter below under "Draft Letter"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vouchers are provided by a company called Edenred. The same company that
      provided FSM vouchers over the summer holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents who receive the letter should go onto the website and redeem their
      voucher by inputting their 16 digit eCode number. They will be asked which
      supermarket they want to use the voucher in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edenred will turn the eCode into an eGift card/voucher with a bar code which
      will then be emailed to the parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parent should download the eGift card/voucher onto their smartphone and
      this should be presented to the cashier at the supermarket till. Alternatively
      the voucher can be printed off and a paper copy taken to the supermarket.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an Edenred User guide and an Edenred Parent FAQ document which are
      both useful as references, these are available on
