  `
    <p>
      The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it illegal for any person to kill,
      injure or take a Badger. It is also an offence to cruelly ill-treat a badger,
      to dig for or to snare a badger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the 1992 Act it is now illegal to damage a badger sett or cause a dog to
      enter a sett. It is also an offence to attempt any of these actions or
      recklessly allow a dog to enter a sett. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also an offence to possess a dead Badger, which has been acquired
      illegally, and to sell or try to sell or keep a live Badger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine of up to £5000 can be imposed for each animal. The courts can also
      confiscate any dogs used in offences against Badgers and disqualify the
      offender from owning a dog.

    <h3>About Bees</h3>
    <p>
     Bees are the main pollinators of many of our wildflowers, crops and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>Many plants would struggle to reproduce if it were not for the bees.
       Bees are on the decline, since the 1950’s many have had their populations halved.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sheffield City Council will only undertake a treatment if the bees are a danger to human health.
    </p>
    <h3>Cost for Treatment</h3>
    <p>
      If the pests are located in a communal area (The area that is shared by multiple Council Housing properties) or 
      required treatment for a domestic properties such as Council Housing, Housing Association, Privately Owned, Private Rented,
      then the treatment cost for Bumble Bees is <strong>£79.20.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you receive one of the following benefits, the treatment cost will be
      reduced to <strong>£61.20.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pension Credits</li>
      <li>Housing Benefits</li>
      <li>Income Support Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Related Job Seekers Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Related Employment Support Allowance</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
      All prices include a call-out fee of £40.80 This fee applies if our officer
      attends the property but is unable to complete the treatment.
    </p>
    <h3>Nests Up High</h3>
    <p>
    Officers carry equipment that enables them to treat a nest located at height.
    In most cases the officer will be able to carry out a successful treatment using such equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
    If any further access equipment is required to treat the nest, our officer will inform you of this at the time of the visit. 
    If further access equipment is required, then it would possibly mean an added cost.
    </p>
    <p>
    If your customer is unsure about the possible additional cost, 
    escalate pest control enquiry and an officer will contact the customer about it.

      Normally, we don't require a sample of fleas before scheduling a
      treatment, as they are small, elusive, and difficult to catch. <br>
      <br>
      However, some individuals may mistakenly believe they have a flea
      infestation due to skin conditions or psychological issues.<br>
    <br>
      Find out if the customer has pets like cats or dogs, as fleas are commonly
      associated with pets. Ask if they've noticed bites, especially on their
      lower legs or ankles. Also, check if they’ve recently moved into a vacant
      property, as fleas can linger in unoccupied homes, and the customer may
      have seen small, dark insects jumping around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes people can believe they have fleas because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They feel something crawling on them</li>
      <li>They are itching</li>
      <li>They are covered in bites all over their body</li>
      <li>They do not have pets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In these cases, we may request a sample or photo for identification.
      Alternatively, we can monitor the property using traps and proceed with
      treatment if fleas are confirmed.

      We will only treat Honey Bees as a last resort and where there is a threat to health.
      <br>
      <br>
      Honey Bees will swarm when the queen lands to rest, with a lot of bees around the queen. Swarming only lasts 
      for a couple of weeks a year and when the bees begin to swarm they will usually disperse within a few hours.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the bees are swarming then we are unable to treat. A swarm would contain hundreds if not thousands of bees.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the bees are definitely Honey Bees and treatment is required for health reasons or the bees are 
      trapped and there is no alternative but to have a treatment, the officer will provide you with 
      a quote for the treatment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, can contact a Bee Keeper to see if they will collect the bees for you. 
      However, Bee keepers will only collect where they have access to the whole swarm, it is unlikely that they 
      will remove bees, which are nesting in a cavity, chimney etc.

    Officers carry equipment that enables them to treat a nest located at height.<br>
    In most cases the officer will be able to carry out a successful treatment using such equipment.<br>
    If any further access equipment is required to treat the nest our officer will inform you of this at the time of the visit. 
    If further access equipment is required, then it would possibly mean an added cost.<br>
    If your customer is unsure about the possible additional cost, escalate the pest control enquiry and an officer will contact the customer about it.

<p>
  A Clean Air Zone is a defined area of a town or city within which certain
  vehicles with more polluting engine standards are charged for entering.
</p>
<p>
  It is not a congestion charging zone and, unlike some other cities, privately
  owned cars, motorbikes, and mopeds will not be charged.
</p>
<p>
  The introduction of a Clean Air Zone aims to reduce exposure to nitrogen
  dioxide produced by road traffic to protect public health in areas where
  pollution levels exceed the maximum legal level. In Sheffield, this area
  includes the inner ring road and everything inside it.

  "Learn about the legal directive behind Sheffield's Category C Clean Air Zone, its aim to reduce Nitrogen Dioxide levels, and the health impacts of air pollution.",

  `
<p>The implementation of the Category C Clean Air Zone in Sheffield is the result of a legal directive from national government requiring Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels to be reduced to legal levels at locations across Sheffield and Rotherham within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The primary aim of Clean Air Zones is to protect the public from exposure to Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) emissions from road traffic. Air pollution can permanently damage children's lungs, can cause strokes, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. Find out the health impacts from air pollution at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-air-pollution" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-air-pollution</a>.

</p>
<p>A number of other local authorities across the UK have also been legally directed to introduce Clean Air Zones - not only Sheffield.</p>
<p>We have worked with DEFRA’s Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU) to form a plan to reduce annual average concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Sheffield. The Clean Air Zone is focused around the city center where some of the most polluted locations are, but it will deliver air quality below the legal limit of 40µg/m<sup>3</sup> across the whole of the city.</p>
