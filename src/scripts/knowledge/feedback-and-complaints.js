    <p> The Adult Social Care Complaints Procedure differs from the Corporate Complaints Procedure. 
    This is because it is governed by the 2009 Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Regulations.</p>

    <p>Customer Services, Feedback and Complaints Team act as Case Coordinator for Adult Social Care complaints.  </p>

<h3>Early resolution</h3>

<p> The focus of complaint handling is not about satisfying a complaints process but seeking to resolve the issues 
our customers raise. </p>

<p>You should only use this form for retrospective recording of a complaint resolved at the first point of contact 
(read the Problem Solving Guide under Documents). 
After 3 working days, if the complaint remains unresolved through problem solving and is not already recorded in the 
Councils Feedback and Complaints case management system (CRM), 
the complaint needs to be recorded using the Complain about Adult Social Care Services form. 
The Customer Feedback and Complaints team will allocate the complaint to the Accountable / 
Reviewing / Investigating Manager in the relevant service. 
Read the Manager Guidance under Documents. </p>

<p> The first task is to write to acknowledge receipt and to say who will be investigating the complaint. 
If the Investigating Manager (IM) has not already spoken to the customer, 
they should do this as soon as possible to clarify the issues raised and 
the outcome sought and agree a timescale for a response. </p>

<p> More detailed information of how to investigate and respond to a complaint is provided in the Corporate 
Complaints Procedure – Effective Complaint handling Guide under Documents. </p>

<h3>Handling a complaint well</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for any issues around consent or safeguarding</li>
    <li>Review the key documentation around the complaint and speak to the people involved</li>
    <li>Having formed an initial view, IMs should discuss their findings with the customer before drafting their response</li>
    <li>Complaint responses should be focused on resolution and address the issues raised in a thorough way, using plain English</li>
    <li>Responses must be sent from the relevant Head of Service, after being checked by the Service Manager</li>
    <li>To help managers carry out their complaints investigation role we have developed the Customer Complaints: Effective Handling on Go Learn.</li>
  </ul>

  and the accompanying guidance “Getting the Best from Complaints.”</p>

  <p>A complaint is eligible for consideration under the Children Act procedure 
  if it is made by an eligible individual as defined by Section 26(3) and section 24D of the Children Act 1989 and section
  3(1) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and the complaint is about a statutory function provided to a child or young person under Part 3, 4 or 5 of the Children Act 1989. 
  Also included are adoption support services and specialist guardian support services.</p>

  <p>If a complaint does not meet the eligibility criteria it will be considered under the Corporate Complaint Procedure.</p>

  `
    <h3>Our Approach</h3>

    <p> Our definition of a complaint is ‘an expression of dissatisfaction, however made, about the standard of service, 
    actions or lack of action by the organisation/landlord, its own staff, or those acting on its behalf, 
    affecting an individual/resident or group of individuals/residents.</p>

    <p>We value our customers’ views on the way we deliver our services. 
    We are committed to using these views to improve our services.  </p>

    <p> When a customer makes a complaint, their complaint will be handled through with the approach set out in this Policy. 
    We will do this irrespective of where and how they make their complaint.</p>

    <h3>Service request enquiry and complaints</h3>

     <p>Our communication with the complainant will not identify individual members of staff or contractors, 
     except in exceptional circumstances, as their actions are undertaken on behalf of the Council.</p>

     <p>Where a response to a complaint falls outside the timescales set out in this Policy, 
     we will agree with the complainant suitable intervals for keeping them informed about their complaint.</p>

     <p>When responding, we will where appropriate, thank the complainant, 
     clearly explain what happened and what we will do, and will apologise and put in place remedies.</p>

     <p>Our tone will be open, responsive and avoid unnecessary formality. 
     Written correspondence will use Plain English.</p>

     <p>Customers who make a complaint will be treated fairly and will not be victimised or 
     discriminated against either in the investigation or conclusion of their complaint, 
     or in any service they receive or request.</p>

     <p>Dealing with complaints is the responsibility of all Sheffield City Council employees.</p>

     <p>We will keep a record of complaints raised by customers.</p>

      <p>We will learn from complaints so that we can improve our service.</p>

     with clear timescales set out for responses.</p>



<h3>Early resolution/Investigation</h3>

<p> You are encouraged wherever possible to provide early and local resolution. Wherever possible, 
seek to resolve the complaint at the first point of contact or within 5 working days of receipt of the complaint. 
Record these consistently in the complaint management recording system (CRM). </p>

<p>This form should only be used for retrospective recording of a complaint resolved at the first point of contact. 
Once resolved, good practise is to ensure some written correspondence is sent to the complainant. 
It should advise/confirm your agreed actions.</p>

<p> If you cannot resolve within 5 working days, or the complaint is too complex to complete within this timeframe, 
then you must ensure that a full investigation is completed and the complainant advised accordingly. </p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>
Within 5 working days of receipt of the complaint.
